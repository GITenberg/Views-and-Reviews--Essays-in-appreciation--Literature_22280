1</span>DICKENS</h2>
<h3>A &lsquo;Frightful Minus&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Mr. Andrew Lang is delightfully severe on those who
&lsquo;cannot read Dickens,&rsquo; but in truth it is only by
accident that he is not himself of that unhappy persuasion.&nbsp;
For Dickens the humourist he has a most uncompromising
enthusiasm; for Dickens the artist in drama and romance he has as
little sympathy as the most practical.&nbsp; Of the prose of
<i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, the
<i>Tale of Two Cities</i> and <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>,
he disdains to speak.&nbsp; He is almost fierce (for him) in his
denunciation of Little Nell and Paul Dombey; he protests that
Monks and Ralph Nickleby are &lsquo;too steep,&rsquo; as indeed
they are.&nbsp; But of Bradley Headstone and Sydney Carton he
says not a word; while of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>&mdash;but here
he shall speak for himself, the italics being a present to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have read in that book a score of
times,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I never see <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>it but I revel
in it&mdash;in Pecksniff and Mrs. Gamp and the Americans.&nbsp;
<i>But what the plot is all about</i>, <i>what Jonas did</i>,
<i>what Montague Tigg had to make in the matter</i>, <i>what all
the pictures with plenty of shading illustrate</i>, <i>I have
never been able to comprehend</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is almost as
bad as the reflection (in a magazine) that Jonas Chuzzlewit is
&lsquo;the most shadowy murderer in fiction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet it
is impossible to be angry.&nbsp; In his own way and within his
own limits Mr. Lang is such a thoroughgoing admirer of Dickens
that you are moved to compassion when you think of the much he
loses by &lsquo;being constitutionally incapable&rsquo; of
perfect apprehension.&nbsp; &lsquo;How poor,&rsquo; he cries,
with generous enthusiasm, &lsquo;the world of fancy would be,
&ldquo;how dispeopled of her dreams,&rdquo; if, in some ruin of
the social system, the books of Dickens were lost; and if The
Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Mr. Crinkle and Miss Squeers and
Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and Dick Swiveller were to perish, or
to vanish with Menander&rsquo;s men and women!&nbsp; We cannot
think of our world without them; and, children of dreams as they
are, they seem more essential than great statesmen, artists,
soldiers, who have actually worn flesh and blood, ribbons and
orders, gowns and uniforms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor is this all.&nbsp;
He is almost prepared to welcome &lsquo;free education,&rsquo;
since &lsquo;every Englishman who can read, unless he be an Ass,
is a reader the more&rsquo; for Dickens.&nbsp; Does it not give
one pause to reflect that the writer <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>of this
charming eulogy can only read the half of Dickens, and is half
the ideal of his own denunciation.</p>
<h3>His Method.</h3>
<p>Dickens&rsquo;s imagination was diligent from the outset; with
him conception was not less deliberate and careful than
development; and so much he confesses when he describes himself
as &lsquo;in the first stage of a new book, which consists in
going round and round the idea, as you see a bird in his cage go
about and about his sugar before he touches it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have no means,&rsquo; he writes to a person wanting
advice, &lsquo;of knowing whether you are patient in the pursuit
of this art; but I am inclined to think that you are not, and
that you do not discipline yourself enough.&nbsp; When one is
impelled to write this or that, one has still to consider:
&ldquo;How much of this will tell for what I mean?&nbsp; How much
of it is my own wild emotion and superfluous energy&mdash;how
much remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and
these ideal circumstances?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in the laborious
struggle to make this distinction, and in the determination to
try for it, that the road to the correction of faults lies.&nbsp;
[Perhaps I may remark, in support of the sincerity with which I
write this, that I am an impatient and impulsive <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>person myself,
but that it has been for many years the constant effort of my
life to practise at my desk what I preach to you.]&rsquo;&nbsp;
Such golden words could only have come from one enamoured of his
art, and holding the utmost endeavour in its behalf of which his
heart and mind were capable for a matter of simple duty.&nbsp;
They are a proof that Dickens&mdash;in intention at least, and if
in intention then surely, the fact of his genius being admitted,
to some extent in fact as well&mdash;was an artist in the best
sense of the term.</p>
<h3>His Development.</h3>
<p>In the beginning he often wrote exceeding ill, especially when
he was doing his best to write seriously.&nbsp; He developed into
an artist in words as he developed into an artist in the
construction and the evolution of a story.&nbsp; But his
development was his own work, and it is a fact that should
redound eternally to his honour that he began in newspaper
English, and by the production of an imitation of the <i>novela
picaresca</i>&mdash;a string of adventures as broken and
disconnected as the adventures of Lazarillo de Tormes or
Peregrine Pickle, and went on to become an exemplar.&nbsp; A man
self-made and self-taught, if he knew anything at all about the
&lsquo;art for art&rsquo; theory&mdash;which is doubtful&mdash;he
may <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>well have held it cheap enough.&nbsp; But he practised
Millet&rsquo;s dogma&mdash;<i>Dans l&rsquo;art il faut sa
peau</i>&mdash;as resolutely as Millet himself, and that, too,
under conditions that might have proved utterly demoralising had
he been less robust and less sincere.&nbsp; He began as a serious
novelist with Ralph Nickleby and Lord Frederick Verisopht; he
went on to produce such masterpieces as Jonas Chuzzlewit and
Doubledick, and Eugene Wrayburn and the immortal Mrs. Gamp, and
Fagin and Sikes and Sydney Carton, and many another.&nbsp; The
advance is one from positive weakness to positive strength, from
ignorance to knowledge, from incapacity to mastery, from the
manufacture of lay figures to the creation of human beings.</p>
<h3>His Results.</h3>
<p>His faults were many and grave.&nbsp; He wrote some nonsense;
he sinned repeatedly against taste; he could be both noisy and
vulgar; he was apt to be a caricaturist where he should have been
a painter; he was often mawkish and often extravagant; and he was
sometimes more inept than a great writer has ever been.&nbsp; But
his work, whether bad or good, has in full measure the quality of
sincerity.&nbsp; He meant what he did: and he meant it with his
whole heart.&nbsp; He looked upon himself as representative <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and
national&mdash;as indeed he was; he regarded his work as a
universal possession; and he determined to do nothing that for
lack of pains should prove unworthy of his function.&nbsp; If he
sinned it was unadvisedly and unconsciously; if he failed it was
because he knew no better.&nbsp; You feel that as you read.&nbsp;
The freshness and fun of <i>Pickwick</i>&mdash;a comic
middle-class epic, so to speak&mdash;seem mainly due to high
spirits; and perhaps that immortal book should be described as a
first improvisation by a young man of genius not yet sure of
either expression or ambition and with only vague and momentary
ideas about the duties and necessities of art.&nbsp; But from
<i>Pickwick</i> onwards to <i>Edwin Drood</i> the effort after
improvement is manifest.&nbsp; What are <i>Dombey</i> and
<i>Dorrit</i> themselves but the failures of a great and serious
artist?&nbsp; In truth the man&rsquo;s genius did but ripen with
years and labour; he spent his life in developing from a popular
writer into an artist.&nbsp; He extemporised <i>Pickwick</i>, it
may be, but into <i>Copperfield</i> and <i>Chuzzlewit</i> and the
<i>Tale of Two Cities</i> and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> he put his
whole might, working at them with a passion of determination not
exceeded by Balzac himself.&nbsp; He had enchanted the public
without an effort; he was the best-beloved of modern writers
almost from the outset of his career.&nbsp; But he had in him at
least as much of the French artist as of the middle-class
Englishman; and if all his life he never ceased from <!-- page
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>self-education but went unswervingly in pursuit of
culture, it was out of love for his art and because his
conscience as an artist would not let him do otherwise.&nbsp; We
have been told so often to train ourselves by studying the
practice of workmen like Gautier and Hugo and imitating the
virtues of work like <i>Hernani</i> and
<i>Quatre-Vingt-Treize</i> and <i>l&rsquo;Education
Sentimentale</i>&mdash;we have heard so much of the
&aelig;sthetic impeccability of Young France and the section of
Young England that affects its qualities and reproduces its
fashions&mdash;that it is hard to refrain from asking if, when
all is said, we should not do well to look for models nearer
home? if in place of such moulds of form as <i>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</i> we might not take to considering stuff like
<i>Rizpah</i> and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>?</p>
<h3>Ave atque Vale.</h3>
<p>Yes, he had many and grave faults.&nbsp; But so had Sir Walter
and the good Dumas; so, to be candid, had Shakespeare
himself&mdash;Shakespeare the king of poets.&nbsp; To myself he
is always the man of his unrivalled and enchanting
letters&mdash;is always an incarnation of generous and abounding
gaiety, a type of beneficent earnestness, a great expression of
intellectual vigour and emotional vivacity.&nbsp; I love to
remember that I came into the world <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>contemporaneously with some of his bravest work, and to
reflect that even as he was the inspiration of my boyhood so is
he a delight of my middle age.&nbsp; I love to think that while
English literature endures he will be remembered as one that
loved his fellow-men, and did more to make them happy and amiable
than any other writer of his time.</p>

9</span>THACKERAY</h2>
<h3>His Worshippers.</h3>
<p>It is odd to note how opinions differ as to the greatness of
Thackeray and the value of his books.&nbsp; Some regard him as
the greatest novelist of his age and country and as one of the
greatest of any country and any age.&nbsp; These hold him to be
not less sound a moralist than excellent as a writer, not less
magnificently creative than usefully and delightfully cynical,
not less powerful and complete a painter of manners than
infallible as a social philosopher and incomparable as a lecturer
on the human heart.&nbsp; They accept Amelia Sedley for a very
woman; they believe in Colonel Newcome&mdash;&lsquo;by <i>Don
Quixote</i> out of <i>Little Nell</i>&rsquo;&mdash;as in
something venerable and heroic; they regard William Dobbin and
&lsquo;Stunning&rsquo; Warrington as finished and subtle
portraitures; they think Becky Sharp an improvement upon Mme.
Marneffe and Wenham better work than Rigby; they are in love with
Laura Bell, and refuse to see either cruelty or caricature in
their poet&rsquo;s presentment of Alcide de Mirobolant.&nbsp;
Thackeray&rsquo;s fun, Thackeray&rsquo;s wisdom,
Thackeray&rsquo;s knowledge of <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>men and
women, Thackeray&rsquo;s morality, Thackeray&rsquo;s view of
life, &lsquo;his wit and humour, his pathos, and his
umbrella,&rsquo; are all articles of belief with them.&nbsp; Of
Dickens they will not hear; Balzac they incline to despise; if
they make any comparison between Thackeray and Fielding, or
Thackeray and Richardson, or Thackeray and Sir Walter, or
Thackeray and Disraeli, it is to the disadvantage of Disraeli and
Scott and Richardson and Fielding.&nbsp; All these were well
enough in their way and day; but they are not to be classed with
Thackeray.&nbsp; It is said, no doubt, that Thackeray could
neither make stories nor tell them; but he liked stories for all
that, and by the hour could babble charmingly of <i>Ivanhoe</i>
and the <i>Mousquetaires</i>.&nbsp; It is possible that he was
afraid of passion, and had no manner of interest in crime.&nbsp;
But then, how hard he bore upon snobs, and how vigorously he
lashed the smaller vices and the meaner faults!&nbsp; It may be
beyond dispute that he was seldom good at romance, and saw most
things&mdash;art and nature included&mdash;rather prosaically and
ill-naturedly, as he might see them who has been for many years a
failure, and is naturally a little resentful of other men&rsquo;s
successes; but then, how brilliant are his studies of club
humanity and club manners! how thoroughly he understands the
feelings of them that go down into the West in broughams!&nbsp;
If he writes by preference for people with a <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>thousand a
year, is it not the duty of everybody with a particle of
self-respect to have that income?&nbsp; Is it possible that any
one who has it not can have either wit or sentiment, humour or
understanding?&nbsp; Thackeray writes <i>of</i> gentlemen
<i>for</i> gentlemen; therefore he is alone among artists;
therefore he is &lsquo;the greatest novelist of his
age.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is the faith of the true believer: that
the state of mind of him that reveres less wisely than
thoroughly, and would rather be damned with Thackeray than saved
with any one else.</p>
<h3>His Critics.</h3>
<p>The position of them that wear their rue with a difference,
and do not agree that all literature is contained in <i>The Book
of Snobs</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>, is more easily
defended.&nbsp; They like and admire their Thackeray in many
ways, but they think him rather a writer of genius who was
innately and irredeemably a Philistine than a supreme artist or a
great man.&nbsp; To them there is something artificial in the man
and something insincere in the artist: something which makes it
seem natural that his best work should smack of the literary
<i>tour de force</i>, and that he should never have appeared to
such advantage as when, in <i>Esmond</i> and in <i>Barry
Lyndon</i>, he was writing up to a standard and upon a model <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>not wholly of his own contrivance.&nbsp; They admit his
claim to eminence as an adventurer in &lsquo;the discovery of the
Ugly&rsquo;; but they contend that even there he did his work
more shrewishly and more pettily than he might; and in this
connection they go so far as to reflect that a snob is not only
&lsquo;one who meanly admires mean things,&rsquo; as his own
definition declares, but one who meanly detests mean things as
well.&nbsp; They agree with Walter Bagehot that to be perpetually
haunted by the plush behind your chair is hardly a sign of lofty
literary and moral genius; and they consider him narrow and
vulgar in his view of humanity, limited in his outlook upon life,
inclined to be envious, inclined to be tedious and pedantic,
prone to repetitions, and apt in bidding for applause to appeal
to the baser qualities of his readers and to catch their sympathy
by making them feel themselves spitefully superior to their
fellow-men.&nbsp; They look at his favourite heroines&mdash;at
Laura and Ethel and Amelia; and they can but think him stupid who
could ever have believed them interesting or admirable or
attractive or true.&nbsp; They listen while he regrets it is
impossible for him to attempt the picture of a man; and, with
Barry Lyndon in their mind&rsquo;s eye and the knowledge that
Casanova and Andrew Bowes suggested no more than that, they
wonder if the impossibility was not a piece of luck for
him.&nbsp; They hear him heaping contumely upon the murders and
adulteries, the <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>excesses in emotion, that pleased the
men of 1830 as they had pleased the Elizabethans before them; and
they see him turning with terror and loathing from
these&mdash;which after all are effects of vigorous
passion&mdash;to busy himself with the elaborate and careful
narrative of how Barnes Newcome beat his wife, and Mrs. Mackenzie
scolded Colonel Newcome to death, and old Twysden bragged and
cringed himself into good society and an interest in the life and
well-being of a little cad like Captain Woolcomb; and it is not
amazing if they think his morality more dubious in some ways than
the morality he is so firmly fixed to ridicule and to
condemn.&nbsp; They reflect that he sees in Beatrix no more than
the makings of a Bernstein; and they are puzzled, when they come
to mark the contrast between the two portraitures and the
difference between the part assigned to Mrs. Esmond and the part
assigned to the Baroness, to decide if he were short-sighted or
ungenerous, if he were inapprehensive or only cruel.&nbsp; They
weary easily of his dogged and unremitting pursuit of the merely
conventional man and the merely conventional woman; they cannot
always bring themselves to be interested in the cupboard drama,
the tea-cup tragedies and cheque-book and bandbox comedies, which
he regards as the stuff of human action and the web of human
life; and from their theory of existence they positively refuse
to eliminate the heroic qualities of romance <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and mystery
and passion, which are&mdash;as they have only to open their
newspapers to see&mdash;essentials of human achievement and
integral elements of human character.&nbsp; They hold that his
books contain some of the finest stuff in fiction: as, for
instance, Rawdon Crawley&rsquo;s discovery of his wife and Lord
Steyne, and Henry Esmond&rsquo;s return from the wars, and those
immortal chapters in which the Colonel and Frank Castlewood
pursue and run down their kinswoman and the Prince.&nbsp; But
they hold, too, that their influence is dubious, and that few
have risen from them one bit the better or one jot the
happier.</p>
<h3>Which is Right?</h3>
<p>Genius apart, Thackeray&rsquo;s morality is that of a highly
respectable British cynic; his intelligence is largely one of
trifles; he is wise over trivial and trumpery things.&nbsp; He
delights in reminding us&mdash;with an air!&mdash;that everybody
is a humbug; that we are all rank snobs; that to misuse your
aspirates is to be ridiculous and incapable of real merit; that
Miss Blank has just slipped out to post a letter to Captain
Jones; that Miss Dash wears false teeth and a wig; that General
Tufto is almost as tightly laced as the beautiful Miss Hopper;
that there&rsquo;s a bum-bailiff in the kitchen at Number
Thirteen; that the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>dinner we ate t&rsquo;other day at
Timmins&rsquo;s is still to pay; that all is vanity; that
there&rsquo;s a skeleton in every house; that passion,
enthusiasm, excess of any sort, is unwise, abominable, a little
absurd; and so forth.&nbsp; And side by side with these
assurances are admirable sketches of character and still more
admirable sketches of habit and of manners&mdash;are the Pontos
and Costigan, Gandish and Talbot Twysden and the unsurpassable
Major, Sir Pitt and Brand Firmin, the heroic De la Pluche and the
engaging Farintosh and the versatile Honeyman, a crowd of vivid
and diverting portraitures besides; but they are not
different&mdash;in kind at least&mdash;from the reflections
suggested by the story of their several careers and the
development of their several individualities.&nbsp; Esmond apart,
there is scarce a man or a woman in Thackeray whom it is possible
to love unreservedly or thoroughly respect.&nbsp; That gives the
measure of the man, and determines the quality of his
influence.&nbsp; He was the average clubman <i>plus</i> genius
and a style.&nbsp; And, if there is any truth in the theory that
it is the function of art not to degrade but to ennoble&mdash;not
to dishearten but to encourage&mdash;not to deal with things ugly
and paltry and mean but with great things and beautiful and
lofty&mdash;then, it is argued, his example is one to depreciate
and to condemn.</p>
<h3><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span> His Style.</h3>
<p>Thus the two sects: the sect of them that are with Thackeray
and the sect of them that are against him.&nbsp; Where both agree
is in the fact of Thackeray&rsquo;s pre-eminence as a writer of
English and the master of one of the finest prose styles in
literature.&nbsp; His manner is the perfection of conversational
writing.&nbsp; Graceful yet vigorous; adorably artificial yet
incomparably sound; touched with modishness yet informed with
distinction; easily and happily rhythmical yet full of colour and
quick with malice and with meaning; instinct with urbanity and
instinct with charm&mdash;it is a type of high-bred English, a
climax of literary art.&nbsp; He may not have been a great man
but assuredly he was a great writer; he may have been a faulty
novelist but assuredly he was a rare artist in words.&nbsp;
Setting aside Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s, the style he wrote is
certainly less open to criticism than that of any other modern
Englishman.&nbsp; He was neither super-eloquent like Mr. Ruskin
nor a Germanised Jeremy like Carlyle; he was not marmoreally
emphatic as Landor was, nor was he slovenly and inexpressive as
was the great Sir Walter; he neither dallied with antithesis like
Macaulay nor rioted in verbal vulgarisms with Dickens; he
abstained from technology and what may be called Lord-Burleighism
as carefully as George Eliot indulged in them, and he avoided
conceits as sedulously as Mr. George Meredith goes out of his way
to hunt for them.&nbsp; He is a better <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>writer than
any one of these, in that he is always a master of speech and of
himself, and that he is always careful yet natural and choice yet
seemingly spontaneous.&nbsp; He wrote as a very prince among
talkers, and he interfused and interpenetrated English with the
elegant and cultured fashion of the men of Queen Anne and with
something of the warmth, the glow, the personal and romantic
ambition, peculiar to the century of Byron and Keats, of Landor
and Dickens, of Ruskin and Tennyson and Carlyle.&nbsp; Unlike his
only rival, he had learnt his art before he began to practise
it.&nbsp; Of the early work of the greater artist a good half is
that of a man in the throes of education: the ideas, the
thoughts, the passion, the poetry, the humour, are of the best,
but the expression is self-conscious, strained, ignorant.&nbsp;
Thackeray had no such blemish.&nbsp; He wrote dispassionately,
and he was a born writer.&nbsp; In him there is no hesitation, no
fumbling, no uncertainty.&nbsp; The style of <i>Barry Lyndon</i>
is better and stronger and more virile than the style of
<i>Philip</i>; and unlike the other man&rsquo;s, whose latest
writing is his best, their author&rsquo;s evolution was towards
decay.</p>
<h3>His Mission.</h3>
<p>He is so superior a person that to catch him tripping is a
peculiar pleasure.&nbsp; It is a satisfaction <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>apart, for
instance, to reflect that he has (it must be owned) a certain
gentility of mind.&nbsp; Like the M.P. in <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, he represents the Gentlemanly Interest.&nbsp;
That is his mission in literature, and he fulfils it
thoroughly.&nbsp; He appears sometimes as Mr. Yellowplush,
sometimes as Mr. Fitzboodle, sometimes as Michael Angelo
Titmarsh, but always in the Gentlemanly Interest.&nbsp; In his
youth (as ever) he is found applauding the well-bred Charles de
Bernard, and remarking of Balzac and Dumas that the one is
&lsquo;not fit for the <i>salon</i>,&rsquo; and the other
&lsquo;about as genteel as a courier.&rsquo;&nbsp; Balzac and
Dumas are only men of genius and great artists: the real thing is
to be &lsquo;genteel&rsquo; and write&mdash;as <i>Gerfeuil</i>
(<i>sic</i>) is written&mdash;&lsquo;in a gentleman-like
style.&rsquo;&nbsp; A few pages further on in the same
pronouncement (a review of <i>J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Paturot</i>), I
find him quoting with entire approval Reybaud&rsquo;s sketch of
&lsquo;a great character, in whom the <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of
Paris will perhaps recognise a certain likeness to a certain
celebrity of the present day, by name Monsieur Hector Berlioz,
the musician and critic.&rsquo;&nbsp; The description is too long
to quote.&nbsp; It sparkles with all the <i>fadaises</i> of
anti-Berliozian criticism, and the point is that the hero, after
conducting at a private party (which Berlioz never did) his own
&lsquo;hymn of the creation that has been lost since the days of
the deluge,&rsquo; &lsquo;called for his cloak and his clogs, and
walked home, where he wrote a critique for the <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>newspapers of
the music which he had composed and directed.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the
Gentlemanly Interest Mr. Titmarsh translates this sorry little
libel with the utmost innocence of approval.&nbsp; It is <i>The
Paris Sketch-Book</i> over again.&nbsp; That Monsieur Hector
Berlioz may possibly have known something of his trade and been
withal as honest a man and artist as himself seems never to have
occurred to him.&nbsp; He knows nothing of Monsieur Hector except
that he is a &lsquo;hairy romantic,&rsquo; and that whatever he
wrote it was not <i>Batti</i>, <i>batti</i>; but that nothing is
enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whether this little picture is a likeness or
not,&rsquo; he is ingenuous enough to add, &lsquo;who shall
say?&rsquo;&nbsp; But,&mdash;and here speaks the bold but
superior Briton&mdash;&lsquo;it is a good caricature of a race in
France, where geniuses <i>poussent</i> as they do nowhere else;
where poets are prophets, where romances have
revelations.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he goes on to qualify
<i>J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Paturot</i> as a
&lsquo;masterpiece,&rsquo; and as &lsquo;three volumes of satire
in which there is not a particle of bad blood,&rsquo; it seems
fair to conclude that in the Gentlemanly Interest all is
considered fair, and that to accuse a man of writing criticisms
on his own works is to be &lsquo;witty and entertaining,&rsquo;
and likewise &lsquo;careless, familiar, and sparkling&rsquo; to
the genteelest purpose possible in this genteelest of all
possible worlds.</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>DISRAELI</h2>
<h3>His Novels.</h3>
<p>To the general his novels must always be a kind of caviare;
for they have no analogue in letters, but are the output of a
mind and temper of singular originality.&nbsp; To the honest
Tory, sworn to admire and unable to comprehend, they must seem
inexplicable as abnormal.&nbsp; To the professional Radical they
are so many proofs of innate inferiority: for they are full of
pretentiousness and affectation; they teem with examples of all
manner of vices, from false English to an immoral delight in
dukes; they prove their maker a trickster and a charlatan in
every page.&nbsp; To them, however, whose first care is for rare
work, the series of novels that began with <i>Vivian Grey</i> and
ended with <i>Endymion</i> is one of the pleasant facts in modern
letters.&nbsp; These books abound in wit and daring, in
originality and shrewdness, in knowledge of the world and in
knowledge of men; they contain many vivid and striking studies of
character, both portrait and caricature; they sparkle with
speaking phrases and happy epithets; they are aglow with the
passion of youth, the love of love, the worship of physical
beauty, the admiration of whatever is <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>costly and
select and splendid&mdash;from a countess to a castle, from a
duke to a diamond; they are radiant with delight in whatever is
powerful or personal or attractive&mdash;from a cook to a
cardinal, from an agitator to an emperor.&nbsp; They often remind
you of Voltaire, often of Balzac, often of <i>The Arabian
Nights</i>.&nbsp; You pass from an heroic drinking bout to a
brilliant criticism of style; from rhapsodies on bands and
ortolans that remind you of Heine to a gambling scene that for
directness and intensity may vie with the bluntest and strongest
work of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e; from the extravagant
impudence of <i>Popanilla</i> to the sentimental rodomontade of
<i>Henrietta Temple</i>; from ranting romanticism in <i>Alroy</i>
to vivid realism in <i>Sybil</i>.&nbsp; Their author gives you no
time to weary of him, for he is worldly and passionate, fantastic
and trenchant, cynical and ambitious, flippant and sentimental,
ornately rhetorical and triumphantly simple in a breath.&nbsp; He
is imperiously egoistic, but while constantly parading his own
personality he is careful never to tell you anything about
it.&nbsp; And withal he is imperturbably good-tempered: he brands
and gibbets with a smile, and with a smile he adores and
applauds.&nbsp; Intellectually he is in sympathy with character
of every sort; he writes as becomes an artist who has recognised
that &lsquo;the conduct of men depends upon the temperament, not
upon a bunch of musty maxims,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;there is a
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>great deal of vice that is really sheer
inadvertence.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is said that the Monmouth of
<i>Coningsby</i> and the Steyne of <i>Vanity Fair</i> are painted
from one and the same original; and you have but to compare the
savage realism of Thackeray&rsquo;s study to the scornful amenity
of the other&rsquo;s&mdash;as you have but to contrast the
elaborate and extravagant cruelty of Thackeray&rsquo;s Alcide de
Mirobolant with the polite and half-respectful irony of
Disraeli&rsquo;s treatment of the cooks in
<i>Tancred</i>&mdash;to perceive that in certain ways the
advantage is not with &lsquo;the greatest novelist of his
time,&rsquo; and that the Monmouth produces an impression which
is more moral because more kindly and humane than the impression
left by the Steyne, while in its way it is every whit as vivid
and as convincing.&nbsp; Yet another excellence, and a great one,
is his mastery of apt and forcible dialogue.&nbsp; The talk of
Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s personages is charmingly equable and
appropriate, but it is also trivial and tame; the talk in Anthony
Trollope is surprisingly natural and abundant, but it is also
commonplace and immemorable; the talk of Mr. George Meredith is
always eloquent and fanciful, but the eloquence is too often dark
and the fancy too commonly inhuman.&nbsp; What Disraeli&rsquo;s
people have to say is not always original nor profound, but it is
crisply and happily phrased and uttered, it reads well, its
impression seldom fails of permanency.&nbsp; His <i>Wit and
Wisdom</i> is a kind of <i>Talker&rsquo;s Guide</i> or
<i>Handbook of Conversation</i>.&nbsp; How <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>should it be
otherwise, seeing that it contains the characteristic utterances
of a great artist in life renowned for memorable speech?</p>
<h3>A Contrast.</h3>
<p>Now, if you ask a worshipper of him that was so long his
rival, to repeat a saying, a maxim, a sentence, of which his idol
is the author, it is odds but he will look like a fool, and visit
you with an evasive answer.&nbsp; What else should he do?&nbsp;
His deity is a man of many words and no sayings.&nbsp; He is the
prince of agitators, but it would be impossible for him to mint a
definition of &lsquo;agitation&rsquo;; he is the world&rsquo;s
most eloquent arithmetician, but it is beyond him to
epigrammatise the fact that two and two make four.&nbsp; And it
seems certain, unless the study of Homer and religious fiction
inspire him to some purpose, that his contributions to axiomatic
literature will be still restricted to the remark that
&lsquo;There are three courses open&rsquo; to something or other:
to the House, to the angry cabman, to what and whomsoever you
will.&nbsp; In sober truth, he is one who writes for to-day, and
takes no thought of either yesterdays or morrows.&nbsp; For him
the Future is next session; the Past does not extend beyond his
last change of mind.&nbsp; He is a prince of journalists, <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>and his excursions into monthly literature remain to
show how great and copious a master of the
&lsquo;leader&rsquo;&mdash;ornate, imposing, absolutely
insignificant&mdash;his absorption in politics has cost the
English-speaking world.</p>
<h3>His Backgrounds.</h3>
<p>Disraeli&rsquo;s imagination, at once practical and
extravagant, is not of the kind that delights in plot and
counterplot.&nbsp; His novels abound in action, but the episodes
wear a more or less random look: the impression produced is
pretty much that of a story of adventure.&nbsp; But if they fail
as stories they are unexceptionable as canvases.&nbsp; Our author
unrolls them with superb audacity; and rapidly and vigorously he
fills them in with places and people, with faces that are as life
and words expressive even as they.&nbsp; Nothing is too lofty or
too low for him.&nbsp; He hawks at every sort of game, and rarely
does he make a false cast.&nbsp; It is but a step from the wilds
of Lancashire to the Arabian Desert, from the cook&rsquo;s first
floor to the Home of the Bellamonts; for he has the
Seven-League-Boots of the legend, and more than the genius of
adventure of him that wore them.&nbsp; His castles may be of
cardboard, his cataracts of tinfoil, the sun of his adjurations
the veriest figment; but he never lets his readers <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>see
that he knows it.&nbsp; His irony, sudden and reckless and
insidious though it be, yet never extends to his
properties.&nbsp; There may be a sneer beneath that mask which,
with an egotism baffling as imperturbable, he delights in
intruding among his creations; but you cannot see it.&nbsp; You
suspect its presence, because he is a born mocker.&nbsp; But you
remember that one of his most obvious idiosyncrasies is an
inordinate love of all that is sumptuous, glittering, radiant,
magnificent; and you incline to suspect that he keeps his
sneering for the world of men, and admires his scenes and
decorations too cordially to visit them with anything so
merciless.</p>
<h3>His Men and Women.</h3>
<p>But dashing and brilliant as are his sketches of places and
things, they are after all the merest accessories.&nbsp; It was
as a student of Men and Women that he loved to excel, and it is
as their painter that I praise him now.&nbsp; Himself a
worshipper of intellect, it was intellectually that he mastered
and developed them.&nbsp; Like Sidonia he moves among them not to
feel with them but to understand and learn from them.&nbsp; Such
sympathy as he had was either purely sensuous, as for youth and
beauty and all kinds of comeliness; or purely intellectual, as
for intelligence, artificiality, servility, <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>meanness.&nbsp; And as his essence was satirical, as he
was naturally irreverent and contemptuous, it follows that he is
best and strongest in the act of punishment not of reward.&nbsp;
His passion for youth was beautiful, but it did not make him
strong.&nbsp; His scorn for things contemptible, his hate for
things hateful, are at times too bitter even for those who think
with him; but in these lay his force&mdash;they filled his brain
with light, and they touched his lips with fire.&nbsp; The
wretched Rigby is far more vigorous and life-like than the
amiable Coningsby; Tom Cogit&mdash;a sketch, but a sketch of
genius&mdash;is infinitely more interesting than May Dacre or
even the Young Duke; Tancred is a good fellow, and very real and
true in his goodness, but contrast him with Fakredeen!&nbsp; And
after his knaves, his fools, his tricksters, the most striking
figures in his gallery are those whom he has considered from a
purely intellectual point of view: either kindly, as Sidonia, or
coolly, as Lord Monmouth, but always calmly and with no point of
passion in his regard: the Eskdales, Villebecques, Ormsbys,
Bessos, Marneys, Meltons, and Mirabels, the Bohuns and St.
Aldegondes and Grandisons, the Tadpoles and the Tapers, the
dominant and subaltern humanity of the world.&nbsp; All these are
drawn with peculiar boldness of line, precision of touch, and
clearness of intention.&nbsp; And as with his men so is it with
his women: the finest are not those he likes best but those who
interested him <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>most.&nbsp; Male and female, his
eccentrics surpass his commonplaces.&nbsp; He had a great regard
for girls, and his attitude towards them, or such of them as he
elected heroines, was mostly one of adoration&mdash;magnificent
yet a little awkward and strained.&nbsp; With women, married
women, he had vastly more in common: he could admire, study,
divine, without having to feign a warmer feeling; and while his
girls are poor albeit splendid young persons, his matrons are
usually delightful.&nbsp; Edith Millbank is not a very striking
figure in <i>Coningsby</i>; but her appearance in
<i>Tancred</i>&mdash;well, you have only to compare it to the
resurrection of Laura Bell, as Mrs. Pendennis to see how good it
is.</p>
<h3>His Style.</h3>
<p>Now and then the writing is bad, and the thought is
stale.&nbsp; Disraeli had many mannerisms, innate and
acquired.&nbsp; His English was frequently loose and
inexpressive; he was apt to trip in his grammar, to stumble over
&lsquo;and which,&rsquo; and to be careless about the connection
between his nominatives and his verbs.&nbsp; Again, he could
scarce ever refrain from the use of gorgeous commonplaces of
sentiment and diction.&nbsp; His taste was sometimes ornately and
barbarically conventional; he wrote as an orator, and his phrases
often read as if he had used them <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>for the sake
of their associations rather than themselves.&nbsp; His works are
a casket of such stage jewels of expression as &lsquo;Palladian
structure,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tusculan repose,&rsquo; &lsquo;Gothic
pile,&rsquo; &lsquo;pellucid brow,&rsquo; &lsquo;mossy
cell,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dew-bespangled meads.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
delighted in &lsquo;hyacinthine curls&rsquo; and &lsquo;lustrous
locks,&rsquo; in &lsquo;smiling parterres&rsquo; and
&lsquo;stately terraces.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seldom sat down in print
to anything less than a &lsquo;banquet&rsquo;, he was capable of
invoking &lsquo;the iris pencil of Hope&rsquo;; he could not
think nor speak of the beauties of woman except as
&lsquo;charms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which seems to show that to be
&lsquo;born in a library,&rsquo; and have Voltaire&mdash;that
impeccable master of the phrase&mdash;for your chief of early
heroes and exemplars is not everything.</p>
<h3>His Oratory.</h3>
<p>It is admitted, I believe, that he had many of the qualities
of a great public speaker: that he had an admirable voice and an
excellent method; that his sequences were logical and natural,
his arguments vigorous and persuasive; that he was an artist in
style, and in the course of a single speech could be eloquent and
vivacious, ornate and familiar, passionate and cynical,
deliberately rhetorical and magnificently fantastic in turn; that
he was a master of all oratorical modes&mdash;of irony and
argument, of stately <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>declamation and brilliant and
unexpected antithesis, of caricature and statement and rejoinder
alike; that he could explain, denounce, retort, retract, advance,
defy, dispute, with equal readiness and equal skill; that he was
unrivalled in attack and unsurpassed in defence; and that in
heated debate and on occasions when he felt himself justified in
putting forth all his powers and in striking in with the full
weight of his imperious and unique personality he was the most
dangerous antagonist of his time.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of his
mysterious and commanding influence over his followers&mdash;in
spite, too, of the fact that he died assuredly the most romantic
and perhaps the most popular figure of his time&mdash;it is
admitted withal that he was lacking in a certain quality of
temperament, that attribute great orators possess in common with
great actors: the power, that is, of imposing oneself upon an
audience not by argument nor by eloquence, not by the perfect
utterance of beautiful and commanding speech nor by the
enunciation of eternal principles or sympathetic and stirring
appeals, but by an effect of personal magnetism, by the
expression through voice and gesture and presence of an
individuality, a temperament, call it what you will, that may be
and is often utterly commonplace but is always inevitably
irresistible.&nbsp; He could slaughter an opponent, or butcher a
measure, or crumple up a theory with unrivalled <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>adroitness
and despatch; but he could not dominate a crowd to the extent of
persuading it to feel with his heart, think with his brain, and
accept his utterances as the expression not only of their common
reason but of their collective sentiment as well.&nbsp; He was as
incapable of such a feat as Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Midlothian
campaign as Mr. Gladstone is of producing the gaming scene in
<i>The Young Duke</i> or the &lsquo;exhausted volcanoes&rsquo;
paragraph in the Manchester speech.</p>
<h3>His Speeches as Literature.</h3>
<p>As a rule&mdash;a rule to which there are some magnificent
exceptions&mdash;orators have only to cease from speaking to
become uninteresting.&nbsp; What has been heard with enthusiasm
is read with indifference or even with astonishment.&nbsp; You
miss the noble voice, the persuasive gesture, the irresistible
personality; and with the emotional faculty at rest and the
reason at work you are surprised&mdash;and it may be a little
indignant&mdash;that you should have been impressed so deeply as
you were by such cold, bald verbosity as seen in black and white
the masterpiece of yesterday appears to be.&nbsp; To some extent
this is the case with these speeches of Disraeli&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
At the height of debate, amid the clash of personal and party
animosities, with <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the cheers of the orator&rsquo;s
supporters to give them wings, they sounded greater than they
were.&nbsp; But for all that they are vigorous and profitable
yet.&nbsp; Their author&rsquo;s unfailing capacity for saying
things worth heeding and remembering is proved in every one of
them.&nbsp; It is not easy to open either of Mr. Kebbel&rsquo;s
volumes without lighting upon something&mdash;a string of
epigrams, a polished gibe, a burst of rhetoric, an effective
collocation of words&mdash;that proclaims the artist.&nbsp; In
this connection the perorations are especially instructive, even
if you consider them simply as arrangements of sonorous and
suggestive words: as oratorical impressions carefully prepared,
as effects of what may be called vocalised orchestration touched
off as skilfully and with as fine a sense of sound and of the
sentiment to correspond as so many passages of instrumentation
signed &lsquo;Berlioz&rsquo; might be.</p>
<h3>The Great Earl.</h3>
<p>Fruits fail, and love dies, and time ranges; and only the
whippersnapper (that fool of Time) endureth for ever.&nbsp;
Moli&egrave;re knew him well, and he said that Moli&egrave;re was
a liar and a thief.&nbsp; And Disraeli knew him too, and he said
that in these respects Disraeli and Moli&egrave;re were
brothers.&nbsp; That he said so matters as <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>little now as
ever it did; for though the whippersnapper is immortal in kind,
he is nothing if not futile and ephemeral in effect, and it was
seen long since that in life and death Disraeli, as became his
genius and his race, was the Uncommonplace incarnate, the
antithesis of Grocerdom, the Satan of that revolt against the
yielding habit of Jehovah-Bottles the spirit whereof is fast
coming to be our one defence against socialism and the dominion
of the Common Fool.&nbsp; He was no sentimentalist: as what great
artist in government has ever been?&nbsp; He loved power for
power&rsquo;s sake, and recognising to the full the law of the
survival of the fittest he preferred his England to the
world.&nbsp; He knew that it is the function of the man of genius
to show that theory is only theory, and that in the House of
Morality there are many mansions.&nbsp; To that end he lived and
died; and it is not until one has comprehended the complete
significance of his life and death that one is qualified to speak
with understanding of such a life and death as his who passed at
Khartoum.</p>

33</span>ALEXANDRE DUMAS</h2>
<h3>His Components.</h3>
<p>The life of Dumas is not only a monument of endeavour and
success, it is a sort of labyrinth as well.&nbsp; It abounds in
pseudonyms and disguises, in sudden and unexpected appearances
and retreats as unexpected and sudden, in scandals and in
rumours, in mysteries and traps and ambuscades of every
kind.&nbsp; It pleased the great man to consider himself of more
importance than any and all of the crowd of collaborators whose
ideas he developed, whose raw material he wrought up into the
achievement we know; and he was given to take credit to himself
not only for the success and value of a particular work but for
the whole thing&mdash;the work in its quiddity, so to speak, and
resolved into its original elements.&nbsp; On the other hand, it
pleased such painful creatures as MM. Qu&eacute;rard and
&lsquo;Eug&egrave;ne de Mirecourt,&rsquo; as it has since pleased
Messrs. Hitchman and Fitzgerald to consider the second- and
third-rate literary persons whom Dumas assimilated in such
numbers as of greater interest and higher merit than Dumas.&nbsp;
To them the jackals were far nobler than the lion, and they
worked their hardest in the interest of the pack.&nbsp; It was
their <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>mission to decompose and disintegrate
the magnificent entity which M. Blaze de Bury very happily
nicknames &lsquo;Dumas-L&eacute;gion,&rsquo; and in the process
not to render his own unto C&aelig;sar but to take from him all
that was C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and divide it among the mannikins
he had absorbed.&nbsp; And their work was in its way well done;
for have we not seen M. Bruneti&egrave;re exulting in agreement
and talking of Dumas as one less than Eug&egrave;ne Sue and not
much bigger than Gaillardet?&nbsp; Of course the ultimate issue
of the debate is not doubtful.&nbsp; Dumas remains to the end a
prodigy of force and industry, a miracle of cleverness and
accomplishment and ease, a type of generous and abundant
humanity, a great artist in many varieties of form, a prince of
talkers and story-tellers, one of the kings of the stage, a
benefactor of his epoch and his kind; while of those who assisted
him in the production of his immense achievement the most exist
but as fractions of the larger sum, and the others have utterly
disappeared.&nbsp; &lsquo;Combien,&rsquo; says his son in that
excellent page which serves to preface <i>le Fils
Naturel</i>&mdash;&lsquo;combien parmi ceux qui devaient rester
obscurs se sont &eacute;clair&eacute;s et chauff&eacute;s
&agrave; ta forge, et si l&rsquo;heure des restitutions sonnait,
quel gain pour toi, rien qu&rsquo;&agrave; reprendre ce que tu as
donn&eacute; et ce qu&rsquo;on t&rsquo;a pris!&rsquo;&nbsp; That
is the true verdict of posterity, and he does well who abides by
it.</p>
<h3><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>Himself.</h3>
<p>He is one of the heroes of modern art.&nbsp; Envy and scandal
have done their worst now.&nbsp; The libeller has said his say;
the detectives who make a specialty of literary forgeries have
proved their cases one and all; the judges of matter have spoken,
and so have the critics of style; the distinguished author of
<i>Nana</i> has taken us into his confidence on the subject; we
have heard from the lamented Granier and others as much as was to
be heard on the question of plagiarism in general and the
plagiarisms of Dumas in particular; and Mr. Percy Fitzgerald has
done what he is pleased to designate the &lsquo;nightman&rsquo;s
work&rsquo; of analysing <i>Antony</i> and <i>Kean</i>, and of
collecting everything that spite has said about their
author&rsquo;s life, their author&rsquo;s habits, their
author&rsquo;s manners and customs and character: of whose
vanity, mendacity, immorality, a score of improper qualities
besides, enough has been written to furnish a good-sized
library.&nbsp; And the result of it all is that Dumas is
recognised for a force in modern art and for one of the greatest
inventors and amusers the century has produced.&nbsp; Whole
crowds of men were named as the real authors of his books and
plays; but they were only readable when he signed for them.&nbsp;
His ideas were traced to a hundred originals; but they had all
seemed worthless till he took them in hand and developed them
according to their innate capacity.&nbsp; The French he wrote was
popular, and the <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>style at his command was none of the
loftiest, as his critics have often been at pains to show; but he
was for all that an artist at once original and exemplary, with
an incomparable instinct of selection, a constructive faculty not
equalled among the men of this century, an understanding of what
is right and what is wrong in art and a mastery of his materials
which in their way are not to be paralleled in the work of Sir
Walter himself.&nbsp; Like Napoleon, he was &lsquo;a natural
force let loose&rsquo;; and if he had done no more than achieve
universal renown as the prince of <i>raconteurs</i> and a
commanding position as a novelist wherever novels are read he
would still have done much.&nbsp; But he did a vast deal
more.&nbsp; A natural force, he wrought in the right direction,
as natural forces must and do.&nbsp; He amused the world for
forty years and more; but he also contributed something to the
general sum of the world&rsquo;s artistic experience and
capacity, and his contribution is of permanent worth and
charm.&nbsp; He has left us stories which are models of the
enchanting art of narrative; and, with a definition good and
comprehensive enough to include all the best work which has been
produced for the theatre from &AElig;schylus down to Augier, from
the <i>Choephor&aelig;</i> on to <i>le Gendre de M. Poirier</i>,
he has given us types of the romantic and the domestic drama,
which, new when he produced them, are even now not old, and which
as regards essentials have yet to be improved upon.&nbsp; The
form <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>and aim of the modern drama, as we know it, have been
often enough ascribed to the ingenious author of <i>une
Cha&icirc;ne</i> and the <i>Verre d&rsquo;Eau</i>; but they might
with much greater truth be ascribed to the author of
<i>Antony</i> and <i>la Tour de Nesle</i>.&nbsp; Scribe invents
and eludes where Dumas invents and dares.&nbsp; The theory of
Scribe is one of mere dexterity: his drama is a perpetual
<i>chass&eacute;-crois&eacute;</i> at the edge of a precipice, a
dance of puppets among swords that might but will not cut and
eggs that might but will not break; to him a situation is a kind
of tight-rope to be crossed with ever so much agility and an
endless affectation of peril by all his characters in turn: in
fact, as M. Dumas <i>fils</i> has said of him, he is &lsquo;le
Shakespeare des ombres chinoises.&rsquo;&nbsp; The theory of
Dumas is the very antipodes of this.&nbsp; &lsquo;All I
want,&rsquo; he said in a memorable comparison between himself
and Victor Hugo, &lsquo;is four trestles, four boards, two
actors, and a passion&rsquo;; and his good plays are a proof that
in this he spoke no more than the truth.&nbsp; Drama to him was
so much emotion in action.&nbsp; If he invented a situation he
accepted its issues in their entirety, and did his utmost to
express from it all the passion it contained.&nbsp; That he fails
to reach the highest peaks of emotional effect is no fault of
his: to do that something more is needed than a perfect method,
something other than a great ambition and an absolute certainty
of touch; and Dumas was neither a Shakespeare nor an <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&AElig;schylus&mdash;he was not even an Augier.&nbsp;
All the same, he has produced in <i>la Tour de Nesle</i> a
romantic play which M. Zola himself pronounces the ideal of the
<i>genre</i> and in <i>Antony</i> an achievement in drawing-room
tragedy which is out of all questioning the first, and in the
opinion of a critic so competent and so keen as the
master&rsquo;s son is probably the strongest, thing of its kind
in modern literature.&nbsp; On this latter play it were
difficult, I think, to bestow too much attention.&nbsp; It is
touched, even tainted, with the manner and the affectation of its
epoch.&nbsp; But it is admirably imagined and contrived; it is
very daring, and it is very new; it deals with the men and women
of 1830, and&mdash;with due allowance for differences of manners,
ideal, and personal genius&mdash;it is in its essentials a play
in the same sense as <i>Othello</i> and the
<i>Trachini&aelig;</i> are plays in theirs.&nbsp; It is the
beginning, as I believe, not only of <i>les Lionnes Pauvres</i>
but of <i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Raquin</i> and <i>la Glu</i> as
well: just as <i>la Tour de Nesle</i> is the beginning of
<i>Patrie</i> and <i>la Haine</i>.</p>
<h3>At Least.</h3>
<p>And if these greater and loftier pretensions be still
contested; if the theory of the gifted creature who wrote that
the works of the master wizard are &lsquo;like summer fruits
brought forth abundantly in the full blaze of sunshine, which do
not keep&rsquo;&mdash;if this preposterous <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>fantasy be
generally accepted, there will yet be much in Dumas to venerate
and love.&nbsp; If <i>Antony</i> were of no more account than an
ephemeral burlesque; if <i>la Reine Margot</i> and the immortal
trilogy of the Musketeers&mdash;that &lsquo;epic of
friendship&rsquo;&mdash;were dead as morality and as literature
alike; if it were nothing to have re-cast the novel of adventure,
formulated the modern drama, and perfected the drama of incident;
if to have sent all France to the theatre to see in three
dimensions those stories of Chicot, Edmond Dant&egrave;s,
d&rsquo;Artagnan, which it knew by heart from books were an
achievement within the reach of every scribbler who dabbles in
letters; if all this were true, and Dumas were merely a piece of
human journalism, produced to-day and gone to-morrow, there would
still be enough of him to make his a memorable name.&nbsp; He was
a prodigy&mdash;of amiability, cleverness, energy, daring, charm,
industry&mdash;if he was nothing else.&nbsp; Gronow tells that he
has sat at table with Dumas and Brougham, and that Brougham,
out-faced and out-talked, was forced to quit the field.&nbsp;
&lsquo;J&rsquo;ai conserv&eacute;,&rsquo; says M. Maxime du Camp,
in his admirable <i>Souvenirs litt&eacute;raires</i>,
&lsquo;d&rsquo;Alexandre Dumas un souvenir ineffa&ccedil;able;
malgr&eacute; un certain laisser-aller qui tenait &agrave;
l&rsquo;exub&eacute;rance de sa nature, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait un
homme <i>dont tous les sentiments &eacute;taient
&eacute;lev&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp; On a &eacute;t&eacute; injuste
pour lui; comme il avait &eacute;norm&eacute;ment d&rsquo;esprit,
on l&rsquo;a accus&eacute; d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre l&eacute;ger; <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>comme il produisait avec une facilit&eacute; incroyable,
on l&rsquo;a accus&eacute; de g&acirc;cher la besogne, et, comme
il &eacute;tait prodigue, on l&rsquo;a accus&eacute; de manquer
de tenue.&nbsp; Ces reproches m&rsquo;ont toujours paru
mis&eacute;rables.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is much; but it is not
nearly all.&nbsp; He had, this independent witness goes on to
note, &lsquo;une g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute; naturelle qui ne
comptait jamais; il ressemblait &agrave; une corne
d&rsquo;abondance qui se vide sans cesse dans les mains tendues;
<i>la moiti&eacute;</i>, <i>sinon plus</i>, <i>de l&rsquo;argent
gagn&eacute; par lui a &eacute;t&eacute;
donn&eacute;e</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is true; and it is also true
that he gave at least as largely of himself&mdash;his prodigious
temperament, his generous gaiety, his big, manly heart, his turn
for chivalry, his gallant and delightful genius&mdash;as of his
money.&nbsp; He was reputed a violent and luxurious debauchee;
and he mostly lived in an attic&mdash;(the worst room in the
house and therefore the only one he could call his
own)&mdash;with a camp-bed and the deal table at which he
wrote.&nbsp; He passed for a loud-mouthed idler; and during many
years his daily average of work was fourteen hours for months on
end.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ivre de puissance,&rsquo; says George Sand of
him, but &lsquo;fonci&egrave;rement bon.&rsquo;&nbsp; They used
to hear him laughing as he wrote, and when he killed Porthos he
did no more that day.&nbsp; It would have been worth while to
figure as one of the crowd of friends and parasites who lived at
rack and manger in his house, for the mere pleasure of seeing him
descend upon them from his toil of moving mountains and sharing
in that pleasing half-hour <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>of talk which
was his common refreshment.&nbsp; After that he would return to
the attic and the deal table, and move more mountains.&nbsp; With
intervals of travel, sport, adventure, and what in France is
called &lsquo;l&rsquo;amour&rsquo;&mdash;(it is strange, by the
way, that he was never a hero of Carlyle&rsquo;s)&mdash;he lived
in this way more or less for forty years or so; and when he left
Paris for the last time he had but two napoleons in his
pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had only one when I came here
first,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;and yet they call me a
spendthrift.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was his way; and while the result
is not for Dr. Smiles to chronicle, I for one persist in
regarding the spirit in which it was accepted as not less
exemplary than delightful.</p>
<h3>His Monument.</h3>
<p>On M. du Camp&rsquo;s authority there is a charming touch to
add to his son&rsquo;s description of him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Il me
semble,&rsquo; said the royal old prodigal in his last illness,
&lsquo;que je suis au sommet d&rsquo;un monument qui tremble
comme si les fondations &eacute;taient assises sur le
sable.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sois en paix,&rsquo; replied the
author of the <i>Demi-Monde</i>: &lsquo;le monument est bien
bati, et la base est solide.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was right, as we
know.&nbsp; It is good and fitting that Dumas should have a
monument in the Paris he amazed and delighted and amused so
long.&nbsp; But he could have done <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>without
one.&nbsp; In what language is he not read? and where that he is
read is he not loved?&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Exegi
monumentum</i>,&rsquo; he might have said: &lsquo;and wherever
romance is a necessary of life, there shall you look for it, and
not in vain.&rsquo;</p>

43</span>GEORGE MEREDITH</h2>
<h3>His Qualities.</h3>
<p>To read Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s novels with insight is to find
them full of the rarest qualities in fiction.&nbsp; If their
author has a great capacity for unsatisfactory writing he has
capacities not less great for writing that is satisfactory in the
highest degree.&nbsp; He has the tragic instinct and endowment,
and he has the comic as well; he is an ardent student of
character and life; he has wit of the swiftest, the most
comprehensive, the most luminous, and humour that can be
fantastic or ironical or human at his pleasure; he has passion
and he has imagination; he has considered sex&mdash;the great
subject, the leaven of imaginative art&mdash;with notable
audacity and insight.&nbsp; He is as capable of handling a vice
or an emotion as he is of managing an affectation.&nbsp; He can
be trivial, or grotesque, or satirical, or splendid; and whether
his <i>milieu</i> be romantic or actual, whether his personages
be heroic or sordid, he goes about his task with the same
assurance and intelligence.&nbsp; In his best work he takes rank
with the world&rsquo;s novelists.&nbsp; He is a companion for
Balzac and Richardson, an intimate for Fielding and
Cervantes.&nbsp; His figures fall into their place <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>beside the greatest of their kind; and when you think of
Lucy Feverel and Mrs. Berry, of Evan Harrington&rsquo;s Countess
Saldanha and the Lady Charlotte of <i>Emilia in England</i>, of
the two old men in <i>Harry Richmond</i> and the Sir Everard
Romfrey of <i>Beauchamp&rsquo;s Career</i>, of Ren&eacute;e and
Cecilia, of Emilia and Rhoda Fleming, of Rose Jocelyn and Lady
Blandish and Ripton Thompson, they have in the mind&rsquo;s eye a
value scarce inferior to that of Clarissa and Lovelace, of Bath
and Western and Booth, of Andrew Fairservice and Elspeth
Mucklebacket, of Philippe Bridau and Vautrin and Balthasar
Cla&euml;s.&nbsp; In the world of man&rsquo;s creation his people
are citizens to match the noblest; they are of the aristocracy of
the imagination, the peers in their own right of the society of
romance.&nbsp; And for all that, their state is mostly desolate
and lonely and forlorn.</p>
<h3>His Defects.</h3>
<p>For Mr. Meredith is one of the worst and least attractive of
great writers as well as one of the best and most
fascinating.&nbsp; He is a sun that has broken out into
innumerable spots.&nbsp; The better half of his genius is always
suffering eclipse from the worse half.&nbsp; He writes with the
pen of a great artist in his left hand and the razor of a
spiritual suicide <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>in his right.&nbsp; He is the master
and the victim of a monstrous cleverness which is neither to hold
nor to bind, and will not permit him to do things as an honest,
simple person of genius would.&nbsp; As Shakespeare, in
Johnson&rsquo;s phrase, lost the world for a quibble and was
content to lose it, so does Mr. Meredith discrown himself of the
sovereignty of contemporary romance to put on the cap and bells
of the professional wit.&nbsp; He is not content to be plain
Jupiter: his lightnings are less to him than his fireworks; and
his pages so teem with fine sayings and magniloquent epigrams and
gorgeous images and fantastic locutions that the mind would
welcome dulness as a bright relief.&nbsp; He is tediously
amusing; he is brilliant to the point of being obscure; his
helpfulness is so extravagant as to worry and confound.&nbsp;
That is the secret of his unpopularity.&nbsp; His stories are not
often good stories and are seldom well told; his ingenuity and
intelligence are always misleading him into treating mere
episodes as solemnly and elaborately as main incidents; he is
ever ready to discuss, to ramble, to theorise, to dogmatise, to
indulge in a little irony or a little reflection or a little
artistic misdemeanour of some sort.&nbsp; But other novelists
have done these things before him, and have been none the less
popular, and are actually none the less readable.&nbsp; None,
however, has pushed the foppery of style and intellect to such a
point as Mr. Meredith.&nbsp; Not infrequently he writes page
after page <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of English as ripe and sound and
unaffected as heart could wish; and you can but impute to
wantonness and recklessness the splendid impertinences that
intrude elsewhere.&nbsp; To read him at the rate of two or three
chapters a day is to have a sincere and hearty admiration for him
and a devout anxiety to forget his defects and make much of his
merits.&nbsp; But they are few who can take a novel on such terms
as these, and to read your Meredith straight off is to have an
indigestion of epigram, and to be incapable of distinguishing
good from bad: the author of the parting between Richard and Lucy
Feverel&mdash;a high-water mark of novelistic passion and
emotion&mdash;from the creator of Mr. Raikes and Dr. Shrapnel,
which are two of the most flagrant unrealities ever perpetrated
in the name of fiction by an artist of genius.</p>
<h3>Another Way.</h3>
<p>On the whole, I think, he does not often say anything not
worth hearing.&nbsp; He is too wise for that; and, besides, he is
strenuously in earnest about his work.&nbsp; He has a noble sense
of the dignity of art and the responsibilities of the artist; he
will set down nothing that is to his mind unworthy to be
recorded; his treatment of his material is distinguished by the
presence of an intellectual passion <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>(as it were)
that makes whatever he does considerable and deserving of
attention and respect.&nbsp; But unhappily the will is not seldom
unequal to the deed: the achievement is often leagues in rear of
the inspiration; the attempt at completeness is too laboured and
too manifest&mdash;the feat is done but by a painful and
ungraceful process.&nbsp; There <i>is</i> genius, but there is
<i>not</i> felicity: that, one is inclined to say, is the
distinguishing note of Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s work, in prose and
verse alike.&nbsp; There are magnificent exceptions, of course,
but they prove the rule and, broken though it be, there is no
gainsaying its existence.&nbsp; To be concentrated in form, to be
suggestive in material, to say nothing that is not of permanent
value, and only to say it in such terms as are charged to the
fullest with significance&mdash;this would seem to be the aim and
end of Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s ambition.&nbsp; Of simplicity in his
own person he appears incapable.&nbsp; The texture of his
expression must be stiff with allusion, or he deems it ill spun;
there must be something of antic in his speech, or he cannot
believe he is addressing himself to the Immortals; he has praised
with perfect understanding the lucidity, the elegance, the ease,
of Moli&egrave;re, and yet his aim in art (it would appear) is to
be Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s antipodes, and to vanquish by
congestion, clottedness, an anxious and determined dandyism of
form and style.&nbsp; There is something <i>bourgeois</i> in his
intolerance of the commonplace, something fanatical <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in
the intemperance of his regard for artifice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Le
dandy,&rsquo; says Baudelaire, &lsquo;doit aspirer &agrave;
&ecirc;tre sublime sans interruption.&nbsp; Il doit vivre et
dormir devant un miroir.&rsquo;&nbsp; That, you are tempted to
believe, is Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s theory of expression.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ce qu&rsquo;il y a dans le mauvais go&ucirc;t,&rsquo; is
elsewhere the opinion of the same unamiable artist in paradox,
&lsquo;c&rsquo;est le plaisir aristocratique de
d&eacute;plaire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Is that, you ask yourself, the
reason why Mr. Meredith is so contemptuous of the general
public?&mdash;why he will stoop to no sort of concession nor
permit himself a mite of patience with the herd whose intellect
is content with such poor fodder as Scott and Dickens and
Dumas?&nbsp; Be it as it may, the effect is the same.&nbsp; Our
author is bent upon being &lsquo;uninterruptedly sublime&rsquo;;
and we must take him as he wills and as we find him.&nbsp; He
loses of course; and we suffer.&nbsp; But none the less do we
cherish his society, and none the less are we interested in his
processes, and enchanted (when we are clever enough) by his
results.&nbsp; He lacks felicity, I have said; but he has charm
as well as power, and, once his rule is accepted, there is no way
to shake him off.&nbsp; The position is that of the antique
tyrant in a commonwealth once republican and free.&nbsp; You
resent the domination, but you enjoy it too, and with or against
your will you admire the author of your slavery.</p>
<h3><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Rhoda Fleming.</h3>
<p><i>Rhoda Fleming</i> is one of the least known of the novels,
and in a sense it is one of the most disagreeable.&nbsp; To the
general it has always been caviare, and caviare it is likely to
remain; for the general is before all things respectable, and no
such savage and scathing attack upon the superstitions of
respectability as <i>Rhoda Fleming</i> has been written.&nbsp;
And besides, the emotions developed are too tragic, the
personages too elementary in kind and too powerful in degree, the
effects too poignant and too sorrowful.&nbsp; In these days
people read to be amused.&nbsp; They care for no passion that is
not decent in itself and whose expression is not
restrained.&nbsp; It irks them to grapple with problems capable
of none save a tragic solution.&nbsp; And when Mr. Meredith goes
digging in a very bad temper with things in general into the
deeper strata, the primitive deposits, of human nature, the
public is the reverse of profoundly interested in the outcome of
his exploration and the results of his labour.&nbsp; But for them
whose eye is for real literature and such literary essentials as
character largely seen and largely presented and as passion
deeply felt and poignantly expressed there is such a feast in
<i>Rhoda Fleming</i> as no other English novelist alive has
spread.&nbsp; The book, it is true, is full of failures.&nbsp;
There is, for instance, the old bank porter Anthony, who is such
a failure as only a great novelist may perpetrate and survive;
who suggests (with some <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>other of Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s
creations) a close, deliberate, and completely unsuccessful
imitation of Dickens: a writer with whom Mr. Meredith is not
averse from entering into competition, and who, so manifest on
these occasions is his superiority, may almost be described as
the other&rsquo;s evil genius.&nbsp; Again, there is Algernon the
fool, of whom his author is so bitterly contemptuous that he is
never once permitted to live and move and have any sort of being
whatever and who, though he bears a principal part in the
intrigue, like the Blifil of <i>Tom Jones</i> is so constantly
illuminated by the lightnings of the ironical mode of
presentation as always to seem unreal in himself and seriously to
imperil the reality of the story.&nbsp; And, lastly, there are
the chivalrous Percy Waring and the inscrutable Mrs. Lovell, two
gentle ghosts whose proper place is the shadow-land of the
American novel.&nbsp; But when all these are removed (and for the
judicious reader their removal is far from difficult) a treasure
of reality remains.&nbsp; What an intensity of life it is that
hurries and throbs and burns through the veins of the two
sisters&mdash;Dahlia the victim, Rhoda the executioner!&nbsp;
Where else in English fiction is such a &lsquo;human oak
log&rsquo; as their father, the Kentish yeoman William
Fleming?&nbsp; And where in English fiction is such a problem
presented as that in the evolution of which these
three&mdash;with a following so well selected and achieved as
Robert Armstrong and Jonathan <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Eccles and
the evil ruffian Sedgett, a type of the bumpkin gone wrong, and
Master Gammon, that type of the bumpkin old and obstinate, a sort
of human saurian&mdash;are dashed together, and ground against
each other till the weakest and best of the three is broken to
pieces?&nbsp; Mr. Meredith may and does fail conspicuously to
interest you in Anthony Hackbut and Algernon Blancove and Percy
Waring; but he knows every fibre of the rest, and he makes your
knowledge as intimate and comprehensive as his own.&nbsp; With
these he is never at fault and never out of touch.&nbsp; They
have the unity of effect, the vigorous simplicity, of life that
belong to great creative art; and at their highest stress of
emotion, the culmination of their passion, they appeal to and
affect you with a force and a directness that suggest the highest
achievement of Webster.&nbsp; Of course this sounds
excessive.&nbsp; The expression of human feeling in the coil of a
tragic situation is not a characteristic of modern fiction.&nbsp;
It is thought to be not consistent with the theory and practice
of realism; and the average novelist is afraid of it, the average
reader is only affected by it when he goes to look for it in
poetry.&nbsp; But the book is there to show that such praise is
deserved; and they who doubt it have only to read the chapters
called respectively &lsquo;When the Night is Darkest&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Dahlia&rsquo;s Frenzy&rsquo; to be convinced and doubt no
longer.&nbsp; It has been objected to the climax of <i>Rhoda
Fleming</i> that it is unnecessarily <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>inhumane, and
that Dahlia dead were better art than Dahlia living and incapable
of love and joy.&nbsp; But the book, as I have said, is a
merciless impeachment of respectability; and as the spectacle of
a ruined and broken life is infinitely more discomforting than
that of a noble death, I take it that Mr. Meredith was right to
prefer his present ending to the alternative, inasmuch as the
painfulness of that impression he wished to produce and the
potency of that moral he chose to draw are immensely heightened
and strengthened thereby.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Comedians.</h3>
<p>Opinions differ, and there are those, I believe, to whom Alvan
and Clotilde von R&uuml;diger&mdash;&lsquo;acrobats of the
affections&rsquo; they have been called&mdash;are pleasant
companions, and the story of those feats in the gymnastics of
sentimentalism in which they lived to shine is the prettiest
reading imaginable.&nbsp; But others not so fortunate or, to be
plain, more honestly obtuse persist in finding that story
tedious, and the bewildering appearances it deals with not human
beings&mdash;not of the stock of Rose Jocelyn and Sir Everard
Romfrey, of Dahlia Fleming and Lucy Feverel and Richmond
Roy&mdash;but creatures of gossamer and rainbow, phantasms of
spiritual romance, abstractions of remote, dispiriting points in
sexual philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Egoist.</h3>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>Just as Moli&egrave;re in the figures of Alceste and
Tartuffe has summarised and embodied all that we need to know of
indignant honesty and the false fervour of sanctimonious
animalism, so in the person of Sir Willoughby Patterne has Mr.
Meredith succeeded in expressing the qualities of egoism as the
egoist appears in his relations with women and in his conception
and exercise of the passion of love.&nbsp; Between the means of
the two men there is not, nor can be, any sort of
comparison.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re is brief, exquisite, lucid:
classic in his union of ease and strength, of purity and
sufficiency, of austerity and charm.&nbsp; In <i>The Egoist</i>
Mr. Meredith is even more artificial and affected than his wont:
he bristles with allusions, he teems with hints and side-hits and
false alarms, he glitters with phrases, he riots in intellectual
points and philosophical fancies; and though his style does
nowhere else become him so well, his cleverness is yet so
reckless and indomitable as to be almost as fatiguing here as
everywhere.&nbsp; But in their matter the great Frenchman and he
have not much to envy each other.&nbsp; Sir Willoughby Patterne
is a &lsquo;document on humanity&rsquo; of the highest value; and
to him that would know of egoism and the egoist the study of Sir
Willoughby is indispensable.&nbsp; There is something in him of
us all.&nbsp; He is a compendium of the Personal in man; and if
in him the abstract Egoist have not taken on his final shape and
become classic and typical it is <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>not that Mr.
Meredith has forgotten anything in his composition but rather
that there are certain defects of form, certain structural faults
and weaknesses, which prevent you from accepting as conclusive
the aspect of the mass of him.&nbsp; But the Moli&egrave;re of
the future (if the future be that fortunate) has but to pick and
choose with discretion here to find the stuff of a companion
figure to Arnolphe and Alceste and C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne.</p>
<h3>In Metre.</h3>
<p>His verse has all the faults and only some of the merits of
his prose.&nbsp; Thus he will rhyme you off a ballad, and to
break the secret of that ballad you have to take to yourself a
dark lantern and a case of jemmies.&nbsp; I like him best in
<i>The Nuptials of Attila</i>.&nbsp; If he always wrote as here,
and were always as here sustained in inspiration, rapid of march,
nervous of phrase, apt of metaphor, and moving in effect, he
would be delightful to the general, and that without sacrificing
on the vile and filthy altar of popularity.&nbsp; Here he is
successfully himself, and what more is there to say?&nbsp; You
clap for Harlequin, and you kneel to Apollo.&nbsp; Mr. Meredith
doubles the parts, and is irresistible in both.&nbsp; Such fire,
such vision, such energy on <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the one hand
and on the other such agility and athletic grace are not often
found in combination.</p>
<h3>The Fashion of Art.</h3>
<p>This is the merit and distinction of art: to be more real than
reality, to be not nature but nature&rsquo;s essence.&nbsp; It is
the artist&rsquo;s function not to copy but to synthesise: to
eliminate from that gross confusion of actuality which is his raw
material whatever is accidental, idle, irrelevant, and select for
perpetuation that only which is appropriate and immortal.&nbsp;
Always artistic, Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s work is often great
art.</p>
<h2><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>BYRON</h2>
<h3>Byron and the World.</h3>
<p>Two obvious reasons why Byron has long been a prophet more
honoured abroad than at home are his life and his work.&nbsp; He
is the most romantic figure in the literature of the century, and
his romance is of that splendid and daring cast which the people
of Britain&mdash;&lsquo;an aristocracy materialised and null, a
middle class purblind and hideous, a lower class crude and
brutal&rsquo;&mdash;prefers to regard with suspicion and
disfavour.&nbsp; He is the type of them that prove in defiance of
precept that the safest path is not always midway, and that the
golden rule is sometimes unspeakably worthless: who set what
seems a horrible example, create an apparently shameful
precedent, and yet contrive to approve themselves an honour to
their country and the race.&nbsp; To be a good Briton a man must
trade profitably, marry respectably, live cleanly, avoid excess,
revere the established order, and wear his heart in his breeches
pocket or anywhere but on his sleeve.&nbsp; Byron did none of
these things, though he was a public character, and ought for the
example&rsquo;s sake to have done them all, and done them
ostentatiously.&nbsp; He lived hard, and drank hard, and played
hard.&nbsp; <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>He was flippant in speech and
eccentric in attire.&nbsp; He thought little of the sanctity of
the conjugal tie, and said so; and he married but to divide from
his wife&mdash;who was an incarnation of the national virtue of
respectability&mdash;under circumstances too mysterious not to be
discreditable.&nbsp; He was hooted into exile, and so far from
reforming he did even worse than he had done before.&nbsp; After
bewildering Venice with his wickedness and consorting with
atheists like Shelley and conspirators like young Gamba, he went
away on a sort of wild-goose chase to Greece, and died there with
every circumstance of publicity.&nbsp; Also his work was every
whit as abominable in the eyes of his countrymen as his
life.&nbsp; It is said that the theory and practice of British
art are subject to the influence of the British school-girl, and
that he is unworthy the name of artist whose achievement is of a
kind to call a blush to the cheek of youth.&nbsp; Byron was
contemptuous of youth, and did not hesitate to write&mdash;in
<i>Beppo</i> and in <i>Cain</i>, in <i>Manfred</i> and <i>Don
Juan</i> and the <i>Vision</i>&mdash;exactly as he pleased.&nbsp;
In three words, he made himself offensively conspicuous, and from
being infinitely popular became utterly contemptible.&nbsp; Too
long had people listened to the scream of this eagle in wonder
and in perturbation, and the moment he disappeared they grew
ashamed of their emotion and angry with its cause, and began to
hearken to other and more melodious voices&mdash;to Shelley and
Keats, to <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Wordsworth and Coleridge and the
&lsquo;faultless and fervent melodies of Tennyson.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In course of time Byron was forgotten, or only remembered with
disdain; and when Thackeray, the representative Briton, the
artist Philistine, the foe of all that is excessive or abnormal
or rebellious, took it upon himself to flout the author of <i>Don
Juan</i> openly and to lift up his heavy hand against the fops
and fanatics who had affected the master&rsquo;s humours, he did
so amid general applause.&nbsp; Meanwhile, however, the genius
and the personality of Byron had come to be vital influences all
the world over, and his voice had been recognised as the most
human and the least insular raised on English ground since
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In Russia he had created Pushkin and
Lermontoff; in Germany he had awakened Heine, inspired Schumann,
and been saluted as an equal by the poet of <i>Faust</i> himself;
in Spain he had had a share in moulding the noisy and unequal
talent of Espronceda; in Italy he had helped to develop and to
shape the melancholy and daring genius of Leopardi; and in France
he had been one of the presiding forces of a great &aelig;sthetic
revolution.&nbsp; To the men of 1830 he was a special and
peculiar hero.&nbsp; Hugo turned in his wake to Spain and Italy
and the East for inspiration.&nbsp; Musset, as Mr. Swinburne has
said&mdash;too bitterly and strongly said&mdash;became in a
fashion a Kaled to his Lara, &lsquo;his female page or attendant
dwarf.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was in some sort the <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>grandsire of
the Buridan and the Antony of Dumas.&nbsp; Berlioz went to him
for the material for his <i>Harold en Italie</i>, his
<i>Corsaire</i> overture, and his <i>Episode</i>.&nbsp; Delacroix
painted the <i>Barque de Don Juan</i> from him, with the
<i>Massacre de Scio</i>, the <i>Marino Faliero</i>, the <i>Combat
du Giaour et du Pacha</i>, and many a notable picture more.&nbsp;
Is it at all surprising that M. Taine should have found heart to
say that alone among modern poets Byron &lsquo;atteint &agrave;
la cime&rsquo;? or that Mazzini should have reproached us with
our unaccountable neglect of him and with our scandalous
forgetfulness of the immense work done by him in giving a
&lsquo;European <i>r&ocirc;le</i> . . . to English
literature&rsquo; and in awakening all over the Continent so much
&lsquo;appreciation and sympathy for England&rsquo;?</p>
<h3>Byron and Wordsworth.</h3>
<p>He had his share in the work of making Matthew Arnold
possible, but he is the antipodes of those men of culture and
contemplation&mdash;those artists pensive and curious and
sedately self-contained&mdash;whom Arnold best loved and of whom
the nearest to hand is Wordsworth.&nbsp; Byron and Wordsworth are
like the Lucifer and the Michael of the <i>Vision of
Judgment</i>.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s was the genius of revolt, as
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Wordsworth&rsquo;s was the genius of dignified and
useful submission; Byron preached the dogma of private
revolution, Wordsworth the dogma of private apotheosis;
Byron&rsquo;s theory of life was one of liberty and
self-sacrifice, Wordsworth&rsquo;s one of self-restraint and
self-improvement; Byron&rsquo;s practice was dictated by a
vigorous and voluptuous egoism, Wordsworth&rsquo;s by a benign
and lofty selfishness; Byron was the &lsquo;passionate and
dauntless soldier of a forlorn hope,&rsquo; Wordsworth a kind of
inspired clergyman.&nbsp; Both were influences for good, and both
are likely to be influences for good for some time to come.&nbsp;
Which is the better and stronger is a question that can hardly be
determined now.&nbsp; It is certain that Byron&rsquo;s star has
waned, and that Wordsworth&rsquo;s has waxed; but it is also
certain that there are moments in life when the <i>Ode to
Venice</i> is almost as refreshing and as precious as the ode on
the <i>Intimations</i>, and when the epic mockery of <i>Don
Juan</i> is to the full as beneficial as the chaste philosophy of
<i>The Excursion</i> and the <i>Ode to Duty</i>.&nbsp; Arnold was
of course with Michael heart and soul, and was only interested in
our Lucifer.&nbsp; He approached his subject in a spirit of undue
deprecation.&nbsp; He thought it necessary to cite
Scherer&rsquo;s opinion that Byron is but a coxcomb and a
rhetorician: partly, it would appear, for the pleasure of seeming
to agree with it in a kind of way and partly to have the
satisfaction of distinguishing and of showing it to be a
mistake.&nbsp; Then, <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>he could not quote Goethe without
apologising for the warmth of that consummate artist&rsquo;s
expressions and explaining some of them away.&nbsp; Again, he was
pitiful or disdainful, or both, of Scott&rsquo;s estimate; and he
did not care to discuss the sentiment which made that great and
good man think <i>Cain</i> and the <i>Giaour</i> fit stuff for
family reading on a Sunday after prayers, though as Mr. Ruskin
has pointed out, in one of the wisest and subtlest bits of
criticism I know, the sentiment is both natural and beautiful,
and should assist us not a little in the task of judging Byron
and of knowing him for what he was.&nbsp; That Arnold should
institute a comparison between Leopardi and Byron was probably
inevitable: Leopardi had culture and the philosophic mind, which
Byron had not; he is incapable of influencing the general heart,
as Byron can; he is a critics&rsquo; poet, which Byron can never
be; he was always an artist, which Byron was not; and&mdash;it
were Arnoldian to take the comparison seriously.&nbsp; Byron was
not interested in words and phrases but in the greater truths of
destiny and emotion.&nbsp; His empire is over the imagination and
the passions.&nbsp; His personality was many-sided enough to make
his egoism representative.&nbsp; And as mankind is wont to feel
first and to think afterwards, a single one of his heart-cries
may prove to the world of greater value as a moral agency than
all the intellectual reflections that Leopardi contrived <!--
page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>to utter.&nbsp; After examining this and that opinion
and doubting over and deprecating them all, Arnold touched firm
ground at last in a dictum of Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s, the most
pertinent and profound since those of Goethe, to the effect that
in Byron there is a &lsquo;splendid and imperishable excellence
which covers all his offences and outweighs all his defects: the
excellence of sincerity and strength.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this
&lsquo;noble praise&rsquo; our critic agreed so vigorously that
it became the key-note of the latter part of his summing up, and
in the end you found him declaring Byron the equal of Wordsworth,
and asserting of this &lsquo;glorious pair&rsquo; that
&lsquo;when the year 1900 is turned, and the nation comes to
recount her poetic glories in the century which has just then
ended, the first names with her will be these.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
prophecy is as little like to commend itself to the pious votary
of Keats as to the ardent Shelleyite: there are familiars of the
Tennysonian Muse, the Sibyl of <i>Rizpah</i> and <i>Vastness</i>
and <i>Lucretius</i> and <i>The Voyage</i>, to whom it must seem
impertinent beyond the prophet&rsquo;s wont; there are&mdash;(but
<i>they</i> scarce count)&mdash;who grub (as for truffles) for
meanings in Browning.&nbsp; But it was not uttered to please, and
in truth it has enough of plausibility to infuriate whatever
poet-sects there be.&nbsp; Especially the Wordsworthians.</p>
<h2><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>HUGO</h2>
<h3>His Critics.</h3>
<p>To many Hugo was of the race of &AElig;schylus and
Shakespeare, a world-poet in the sense that Dante was, an artist
supreme alike in genius and in accomplishment.&nbsp; To others he
was but a great master of words and cadences, with a gift of
lyric utterance and inspiration rarely surpassed but with a
personality so vigorous and excessive as to reduce its literary
expression&mdash;in epic, drama, fiction, satire and ode and
song&mdash;to the level of work essentially subjective, in
sentiment as in form, in intention as in effect.&nbsp; The debate
is one in which the only possible arbiter is Time; and to Time
the final judgment may be committed.&nbsp; What is certain is
that there is one point on which both dissidents and
devout&mdash;the heretics who deny with Matthew Arnold and the
orthodox who worship with Mr. Swinburne and M. de
Banville&mdash;are absolutely agreed.&nbsp; Plainly Hugo was the
greatest man of letters of his day.&nbsp; It has been given to
few or none to live a life so full of effort and achievement, so
rich in honour and success and fame.&nbsp; Born almost with the
century, he was a writer at fifteen, and at his death he was
writing still; so that the record of <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>his career
embraces a period of more than sixty years.&nbsp; There is hardly
a department of art to a foremost place in which he did not prove
his right.&nbsp; From first to last; from the time of
Chateaubriand to the time of Zola, he was a leader of men; and
with his departure from the scene the undivided sovereignty of
literature became a thing of the past like Alexander&rsquo;s
empire.</p>
<h3>Some Causes and Effects.</h3>
<p>In 1826, in a second set of <i>Odes et Ballades</i>, he
announced his vocation in unmistakeable terms.&nbsp; He was a
lyric poet and the captain of a new emprise.&nbsp; His genius was
too large and energetic to move at ease in the narrow garment
prescribed as the poet&rsquo;s wear by the dullards and the
pedants who had followed Boileau.&nbsp; He began to repeat the
rhythms of Ronsard and the Pleiad; to deal in the richest rhymes
and in words and verses tricked with new-spangled ore; to be
curious in cadences, careless of stereotyped rules, prodigal of
invention and experiment, defiant of much long recognised as good
sense, contemptuous of much till then applauded as good
taste.&nbsp; In a word, he was the Hugo of the hundred volumes we
know: an artist, that is, endowed with a technical imagination of
the highest quality, the very genius of style, <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and a sense
of the plastic quality of words unequalled, perhaps, since
Milton.&nbsp; The time was ripe for him: within France and
without it was big with revolution.&nbsp; In verse there were the
examples of Andr&eacute; Chenier and Lamartine; in prose the work
of Rousseau and Diderot, of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and
Chateaubriand; in war and politics the tremendous tradition of
Napoleon.&nbsp; Goethe and Schiller had recreated romance and
established the foundations of a new palace of art; their theory
and practice had been popularised in the novels of Walter Scott;
and in the life and work of Byron the race had such an example of
revolt, such an incitement to liberty and change, such a
passionate and persuasive argument against authority and
convention, as had never before been felt in art.&nbsp; Hugo like
all great artists was essentially a child of his age:
&lsquo;Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
1827 he published his <i>Cromwell</i>, and came forth as a rebel
confessed and unashamed.&nbsp; It is an unapproachable
production, tedious in the closet, impossible upon the stage; and
to compare it to such work as that which at some and twenty Keats
had given to the world&mdash;<i>Hyperion</i>, for instance, or
the <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i>&mdash;is to glory in the name of
Briton.&nbsp; But it had its value then, and as an historical
document it has its value now.&nbsp; The preface was at once a
profession of faith and a proclamation of war.&nbsp; It is crude,
it is limited, it is mistaken, in places it is <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>even
absurd.&nbsp; But from the moment of its appearance the old order
was practically closed.&nbsp; It prepared the way for
<i>Albertus</i> and for <i>Antony</i>, for <i>Rolla</i> and the
<i>Tour de Nesle</i>; and it was also the &lsquo;<i>fiat
lux</i>&rsquo; in deference to which the world has accepted with
more or less of resignation the partial eclipse of art and morals
effected in <i>Salammb&ocirc;</i> and <i>l&rsquo;Education
sentimentale</i> and the Egyptian darkness achieved in work like
<i>la Terre</i> and <i>une Vie</i> and <i>les
Blasph&egrave;mes</i>.&nbsp; In its ringing periods, its plangent
antitheses and &aelig;sthetic epigrams, it preluded and
vindicated the excesses of whatsoever manifestations of
romanticism mankind and the arts have since been called upon to
consider and endure: from the humours of Petrus Borel to the
experiments of Claude Monet and the &lsquo;discoveries&rsquo; of
Richard Wagner.</p>
<h3>Environment.</h3>
<p>It is too often forgotten that from the first Hugo was
associated with men of pretensions and capacities not greatly
inferior to his own, and that in no direction was victory the
work of his single arm.&nbsp; In painting the initiative had been
taken years before the publication of the <i>Cromwell</i>
manifesto by G&eacute;ricault with the famous <i>Radeau de la
M&eacute;duse</i>, and by Delacroix with the <i>Dante et
Virgile</i> (1822) and the <i>Massacre de Scio</i> (1823).&nbsp;
In music Berlioz, <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>at this time a student in the
Conservatoire, was fighting hard against Cherubini and the
bewigged ones for liberty of expression and leave to admire and
imitate the audacities of Weber and Beethoven, and three years
hence, in the year of <i>Hernani</i>, was to set his mark upon
the art with the <i>Symphonie fantastique</i>.&nbsp; On the stage
as early as 1824 Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick and Firmin had realised
in the personages of Macaire and Bertrand the grotesque ideal,
the combination of humour and terror, of which the character of
Cromwell was put forward as the earliest expression, and had
realised it so completely that their work has taken rank with the
greater and the more lasting results of the movement.&nbsp; In
the literature of drama the old order was ruined and the victory
won on all essential points not in 1830 with <i>Hernani</i> but
in 1829 with <i>Henri Trois et sa Cour</i>, the first of the
innumerable successes of Alexandre Dumas, who determined at a
single stroke the fundamental qualities of structure and form and
material, and left his chief no question to solve save that of
diction and style.&nbsp; Musset&rsquo;s earlier poems date from
1828, the year of <i>les Orientales</i>, Gautier&rsquo;s from
1830; and these are also the dates of Balzac&rsquo;s
<i>Chouans</i> and <i>la Peau de Chagrin</i>.&nbsp; Moreover,
among the intimates of the young leader were men like
Sainte-Beuve, who was two years his junior, and the brothers
Deschamps: whose influence was doubtless exerted more frequently
to encourage than to repress.&nbsp; Towards the <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>end we lost
sight of all this, and saw in Victor Hugo not so much the most
glorious survival of romanticism as romanticism itself, the
movement in flesh and blood, the revolution in general
&lsquo;summed up and closed&rsquo; in a single figure.&nbsp; This
agreeable view of things was Hugo&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; From the
beginning he took himself with perfect seriousness, and his
followers, however enthusiastic in admiration, had excellent
warrant from above.&nbsp; &lsquo;Il <i>tr&ocirc;ne</i>
trop,&rsquo; says Berlioz of him somewhere; and M. Maxime du Camp
has given an edifying account of the means he was wont to use to
make himself beloved and honoured by the youth who came to him
for counsel and encouragement.&nbsp; How perfectly he succeeded
in this the political part of his function is matter of
history.&nbsp; Gautier&rsquo;s first visit to him was that of a
devotee to his divinity; and years afterwards the good poet
confessed that not even in pitch darkness and in a cellar fathoms
under ground should he dare to whisper to himself that a verse of
the Master&rsquo;s was bad.&nbsp; So far as devotion went there
were innumerable Gautiers.&nbsp; Sainte-Beuve was not long a
pillar of orthodoxy; Dumas was always conscious of his own
pre-eminence in certain qualities, and made light of Hugo&rsquo;s
dramas as candidly as he made much of the style in which they are
written; and when some creature of unwisdom saluted Delacroix as
&lsquo;the Hugo of painting,&rsquo; the artist of the <i>Marino
Faliero</i> and the <i>Barque de Don Juan</i> resented the
compliment with <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>bitterness.&nbsp; But these were
exceptions.&nbsp; The youth of 1830 were Hugolaters almost to a
man.</p>
<h3>Equipment and Achievement.</h3>
<p>Their enthusiasm was not all irrational.&nbsp; Hugo&rsquo;s
supremacy was not that he was the greatest artist in essentials,
for here Dumas was immeasurably his superior.&nbsp; It was not
that he knew best the heart of man, or had apprehended most
thoroughly the conditions of life; for Balzac so far surpassed
him in these sciences that comparison was impossible.&nbsp; It
was not that he sang the truest song or uttered the deepest word,
for Musset is the poet of <i>Rolla</i> and the <i>Nuits</i> in
verse and the poet of <i>Fantasio</i> and <i>Lorenzaccio</i> and
<i>Carmosine</i> in prose.&nbsp; But the epoch Hugo represented
was interested in the manner rather than the substance of things:
the revolution at whose front he had been set and whose most
shining figure he became was largely a revolution of
externals.&nbsp; With an immense amount of enthusiasm there was,
as Sainte-Beuve confessed, an incredible amount of
ignorance&mdash;so that <i>Cromwell</i> was supposed to be
historical; and with a passionate delight in form there
co-existed a strangely imperfect understanding of
material&mdash;so that <i>Hernani</i> <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>was supposed
to be Shakespearean.&nbsp; To this ignorance and to this
imperfect understanding Hugo owed a certain part of his
authority; the other and greater he got from his unrivalled
mastery of style, from his extraordinary skill as an artist in
words.&nbsp; To the opposing faction his innovations were
horrible: his verse was poison, his example an outrage, his
prosody a violation of all laws, his rhymes and tropes and
metaphors so many offences against Heaven and the Muse.&nbsp; But
to the ardent youngsters who fought beneath his banner it was his
to give a something priceless and unique&mdash;a something
glorious to France and never before exampled in her
literature.&nbsp; For the distichs of
Boileau&mdash;&lsquo;strong, heavy, useful, like pairs of
tongs,&rsquo;&mdash;he found them alexandrines with the leap and
sparkle of sea waves and the sound of clashing swords and the
colours of sunset and the dawn.&nbsp; They were tired of
whitewash and cold distemper; and he gave them hangings of
brocade and tapestries of price and tissues stiff with gold and
glowing with new dyes.&nbsp; He flung them handfuls of jewels
where his rivals scattered handfuls of marbles.&nbsp; And they
paid him for his gifts with an intemperance of worship, a fury of
belief, a rapture of admiration, such as no other man has
known.&nbsp; The substance was striking, was peculiar, was novel
and full of charm; but the manner was all this and something
besides&mdash;was magnificent, was intoxicating, was
irresistible; and Victor Hugo by <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>virtue of it
became the foremost man of literary France.&nbsp; The great
battle of <i>Hernani</i> was merely a battle of style.&nbsp; From
Dumas the artist of <i>Henri Trois</i> and <i>Antony</i>, the
language of Boileau was safe enough; and his triumph,
all-important and significant as it was, seemed neither fatal nor
abominable.&nbsp; It was another matter with
<i>Hernani</i>.&nbsp; Its success meant ruin for the Academy and
destruction for the idiom of Delille and M. de Jouy; and the
classicists mustered in force, and did their utmost to stay the
coming wrath and arrest the impending doom.&nbsp; They failed of
course; for they fought with a vague yet limited apprehension of
the question at issue, they had nothing to give in place of the
thing they hated.&nbsp; And Victor Hugo was made captain of the
victorious host, while the men who might have been in a certain
sort his rivals took service as lieutenants, and accepted his
ensign for their own.</p>
<h3>His Diary.</h3>
<p>All his life long he was addicted to attitude; all his life
long he was a <i>poseur</i> of the purest water.&nbsp; He seems
to have considered the affectation of superiority an essential
quality in art; for just as the cock in Mrs. Poyser&rsquo;s
apothegm believed that the sun got up to hear him crow, so to the
poet of the <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span><i>L&eacute;gende</i> and the
<i>Contemplations</i> it must have seemed as if the human race
existed but to consider the use he made of his &lsquo;oracular
tongue.&rsquo;&nbsp; How tremendous his utterances sometimes
were&mdash;informed with what majesty yet with what
brilliance&mdash;is one of the things that every schoolboy
knows.&nbsp; One no more needs to insist upon the merits of his
best manner than to emphasise the faults of his worst.&nbsp; At
his best as at his worst, however, he was always an artist in his
way.&nbsp; His speech was nothing if not artificial&mdash;in the
good sense of the word sometimes and sometimes in the bad.&nbsp;
Simplicity (it seemed) was impossible to him.&nbsp; In the quest
of expression, the cult of antithesis, the pursuit of effect, he
sacrificed directness and plainness with not less consistency
than complacency.&nbsp; In that tissue of &lsquo;apocalyptic
epigram&rsquo; which to him was style there was no room for truth
and soberness.&nbsp; His Patmos was a place of mirrors, and
before them he draped himself in his phrases like Frederick in
the mantle of Ruy Blas.&nbsp; That this grandiosity was unnatural
and unreal was proved by the publication of <i>Choses
Vues</i>.&nbsp; When Hugo wrote for himself he wrote almost as
simply and straightforwardly as Dumas.&nbsp; The effect is
disconcerting.&nbsp; You rub your eyes in amazement.&nbsp; It is
evidently Hugo.&nbsp; But Hugo plain, sober, direct?&nbsp; Hugo
without rhetoric?&nbsp; Hugo declining antithesis and content to
be no gaudier than his neighbours?&nbsp; Hugo expressing <!--
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>himself in the fearless old fashion of pre-romantic
ages?&nbsp; A page of commonplace from Mr. Meredith, a book for
boarding-schools by M. Zola, were not more startling.</p>
<h3>For and Against.</h3>
<p>Some primary qualities of his genius are pretty evenly
balanced by some primary faults.&nbsp; Thus, for breadth and
brilliance of conception, for energy and sweep of imagination,
for the power of dealing as a master with the greater forces of
nature, he is unsurpassed among modern men.&nbsp; But the
conception is too often found to be empty as well as spacious;
the imagination is too often tainted with insincerity; in his
dramas of the elements there are too many such falsehoods as
abound in his dramas of the emotions.&nbsp; Again, he is
sometimes grand and often grandiose; but he has a trick of
affecting the grandiose and the grand which is constant and
intolerable.&nbsp; He had the genius of style in such fulness as
entitles him to rank with the great artists in words of all
time.&nbsp; His sense of verbal colour and verbal music is beyond
criticism; his rhythmical capacity is something prodigious.&nbsp;
He so revived and renewed the language of France that in his
hands it became an instrument not unworthy to <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>compete with
Shakespeare&rsquo;s English and the German of Goethe and Heine;
and in the structure and capacity of all manner of French
metrical forms he effected such a change that he may fairly be
said to have received the orchestra of Rameau from his
predecessors and to have bequeathed his heirs the orchestra of
Berlioz.&nbsp; On the other hand; in much of his later work his
mannerisms in prose and in verse are discomfortably glaring; the
outcome of his unsurpassable literary faculty is often no more
than a parade or triumph of the vocables; there were times when
his brain appears to have become a mere machine for the
production of antitheses and sterile conceits.&nbsp; What is
perhaps more damning than all, his work is saturate in his own
remarkable personality, and is objective only here and
there.&nbsp; His dramas are but five-act lyrics, his epics the
romance of an egoist, his history is confession, his criticism
the opinions of Victor Hugo.&nbsp; Even his lyrics, the
&lsquo;fine flower&rsquo; of his genius, the loveliest expression
of the language, have not escaped reproach as a &lsquo;Psalter of
Subjectivity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even his essays in prose
romance&mdash;a form of art on which he has stamped his image and
superscription in a manner all his own, the work by which he is
best known to humanity at large&mdash;are vitiated by the same
defect.&nbsp; For one that believes in Bishop Myriel as Bishop
Myriel there are a hundred who see in him only a pose of Victor
Hugo; it is the same with Ursel and Javert, with <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Cimourdain and Lantenac and Josiane; the very
<i>pieuvre</i> of <i>les Travailleurs</i> is a Hugolater at
heart.&nbsp; It is a proof of his commanding personality, that in
spite of these objections he held in enchantment the hearts and
minds of men for over sixty years.&nbsp; He is almost a
literature in himself; and if it be true that his work is as
wholly lacking in the radiant sanity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s as it
is in the exquisite good sense of Voltaire&rsquo;s, it is also
true that he left the world far richer than he found it.</p>
<h3>What Lives of Him.</h3>
<p>To select an anthology from his work were surely the
pleasantest of tasks.&nbsp; One richer in grace and passion and
sweetness might he chosen out of Musset; one wrought more truly
of the finer stuff of humanity as well as more bountifully
touched with tact and dignity and temper from the work of
Tennyson.&nbsp; But the Hugo selection would combine the rarest
technical merits with a set of interests all its own.&nbsp; It
would give, for instance, the <i>Stella</i> of the
<i>Ch&acirc;timents</i> and the <i>Pauvres Gens</i> of the
<i>L&eacute;gende</i>.&nbsp; On one page would be found that
admirable <i>Souvenir de la Nuit du Quatre</i>, which is at once
the impeachment and the condemnation of the Coup
d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat; and on another the little epic of
<i>Eviradnus</i>, with <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>its immortal serenade, a culmination
of youth and romance and love:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Si tu veux, faisons un r&ecirc;ve.<br />
Montons sur deux palefrois.<br />
Tu m&rsquo;emm&egrave;nes, je t&rsquo;enl&egrave;ve.<br />
L&rsquo;oiseau chante dans les bois.</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>Allons-nous-en par l&rsquo;Autriche!<br />
Nous aurons l&rsquo;aube &agrave; nos fronts.<br />
Je serai grand et toi riche,<br />
Puisque nous nous aimerons.</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>Tu seras dame et moi comte.<br />
Viens, mon &oelig;eur s&rsquo;&eacute;panouit.<br />
Viens, nous conterons ce conte<br />
Aux &eacute;toiles de la nuit.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, a summary of all the interests of romanticism, would be
the complaint of Gastibelza:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Un jour d&rsquo;&eacute;t&eacute;,
o&ugrave; tout &eacute;tait lumi&egrave;re,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vie et douceur,<br />
Elle s&rsquo;en vint jouer dans la rivi&egrave;re<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Avec sa s&oelig;ur.<br />
Je vis le pied de sa jeune compagne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Et son genou . . .&mdash;<br />
Le vent qui vient &agrave; travers la montagne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me rendra fou!&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>here the adorable <i>Vieille Chanson du Jeune Temps</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Rose, droite sur ses hanches,<br />
Leva son beau bras tremblant<br />
Pour prendre une m&ucirc;re aux branches:<br />
Je ne vis pas son bras blanc.</p>
<p>Une eau courait, fra&icirc;che et creuse,<br />
Sur les mousses de velours;<br />
Et la nature amoureuse<br />
Dormait dans les grands bois sourds.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and here, not unworthy to be remembered with <i>Proud
Maisie</i>, that wonderful harmony of legend <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>and
superstition and the facts and dreams of common life, the
death-song of Fantine:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nous acheterons de bien belles choses,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; En nous promenant le long de faubourgs.</p>
<p>La Vierge-Marie aupr&egrave;s de mon po&euml;le<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Est venue hier, en manteau brod&eacute;,<br />
Et m&rsquo;a dit: Voici, cach&eacute; sous mon voile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Le petit qu&rsquo;un jour tu m&rsquo;as
demand&eacute;.<br />
Courez &agrave; la ville; ayez de la toile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Achetez du fil, achetez un d&eacute;.</p>
<p>Les bluets sont bleus, les roses sont roses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Les bluets sont bleus, j&rsquo;aime mes
amours.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from this masterpiece of simple and direct emotion, which
to me has always seemed the high-water mark of Hugo&rsquo;s
lyrical achievement as well as the most human of his utterances,
one might pass on to masterpieces of another inspiration: to the
luxurious and charming graces of <i>Sara la Baigneuse</i>; to the
superb crescendo and diminuendo of <i>les Djinns</i>; to
&lsquo;Si vous n&rsquo;avez rien &agrave; me dire,&rsquo; that
daintiest of songlets; to the ringing rhymes and gallant spirit
of the <i>Pas d&rsquo;Armes du Roi Jean</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sus, ma b&ecirc;te,<br />
De fa&ccedil;on<br />
Que je f&ecirc;te<br />
Ce grison!<br />
Je te baille<br />
Pour ripaille<br />
Plus de paille,<br />
Plus de son,</p>
<p>Qu&rsquo;un gros fr&egrave;re,<br />

Ne peut faire,<br />
Mendiant<br />
Par les places<br />
O&ugrave; tu passes,<br />
De grimaces<br />
En priant!&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the melodious tenderness of &lsquo;Si tu voulais,
Madelaine&rsquo;; to the gay music of the <i>Stances &agrave;
Jeanne</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span

Du clocher ni du beffroi.<br />
Je ne sais rien de la reine,<br />
Et je ne sais rien du roi.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the admirable song of the wind of the sea:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Quels sont les bruits sourds?<br />
Ecoutez vers l&rsquo;onde<br />
Cette voix profonde<br />
Qui pleure toujours,<br />
Et qui toujours gronde,</p>
<p>Quoiqu&rsquo;un son plus claire<br />
Parfois l&rsquo;interrompe . . .<br />
Le vent de la mer<br />
Souffle dans sa trompe.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the <i>Romance Mauresque</i>, to the barbaric fury of
<i>les Re&icirc;tres</i>, to the magnificent rodomontade of the
<i>Romancero du Cid</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;J&rsquo;en passe, et des
meilleurs,&rsquo; as Ruy Gomez observes of his ancestors.&nbsp;
Here at any rate are jewels enough to furnish forth a casket that
should be one of the richest of its kind!&nbsp; The worst is,
they are most of them not necessaries but luxuries.&nbsp; It is
impossible to conceive of life without Shakespeare and Burns,
without <i>Paradise Lost</i> and the <i>Intimations</i> ode and
the immortal pageant of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; but (the
technical question apart) to imagine it wanting Hugo&rsquo;s
lyrics is easy enough.&nbsp; The largesse of which he was so
prodigal has but an arbitrary and conventional value.&nbsp; Like
the magician&rsquo;s money much has changed, almost in the act of
distribution, into withered leaves; and such of it as seems
minted of good metal is not for general circulation.</p>

79</span>HEINE</h2>
<h3>The Villainy Translation.</h3>
<p>Heine had a light hand with the branding-iron, and marked his
subjects not more neatly than indelibly.&nbsp; And really he
alone were capable of dealing adequate vengeance upon his
translators.&nbsp; His verse has only violent lovers or violent
foes; indifference is impossible.&nbsp; Once read as it deserves,
it becomes one of the loveliest of our spiritual
acquisitions.&nbsp; We hate to see it tampered with; we are on
thorns as the translator approaches, and we resent his operations
as an individual hurt, a personal affront.&nbsp; What business
has he to be trampling among our borders and crushing our flowers
with his stupid hobnails?&nbsp; Why cannot he carry his zeal for
topsy-turvy horticulture elsewhere?&nbsp; He comes and lays a
brutal hand on our pet growths, snips off their graces, shapes
them anew according to his own ridiculous ideal, paints and
varnishes them with a villainous compound of his contrivance, and
then bids us admire the effect and thank him for its
production!&nbsp; Is any name too hard for such a creature? and
could any vengeance be too deadly?&nbsp; If he walked into your
garden and amused himself so with your <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>cabbages, you
could put him in prison.&nbsp; But into your poets he can stump
his way at will, and upon them he can do his pleasure.&nbsp; And
he does it.&nbsp; How many men have brutalised the elegance, the
grace, the winning urbanity of Horace!&nbsp; By how many coarse
and stupid fingers has Catullus been smudged and fumbled and
mauled!&nbsp; To turn <i>Faust</i> into English (in the original
metres) is a fashionable occupation; there are more perversions
of the <i>Commedia</i> than one cares to recall; there is scarce
a great or even a good work of the human mind but has been thus
bedevilled and deformed.&nbsp; <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>le
P&egrave;re Goriot</i>, <i>The Frogs</i>, <i>The
Decameron</i>&mdash;the trail of the translator is over them
all.&nbsp; Messrs. Payne and Lang and Swinburne have turned poor
Villon into a citizen of Bedford Park, Fitzgerald and Florence
Macarthy have Englished Calderon, Messrs. Pope, Gladstone and
others have done their worst with Homer.&nbsp; If Rossetti had
not succeeded with <i>la Vita Nuova</i>, if Fitzgerald had not
ennobled Omar, if Mr. Lang had not bettered upon Banville and
G&eacute;rard de Nerval, the word &lsquo;translator&rsquo; would
be odious as the word &lsquo;occupy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
&lsquo;occupy&rsquo; on the authority of Mrs. Dorothy Tearsheet
is an odious word indeed.</p>
<h3>The Proof of It.</h3>
<p>The fact is, the translator too often forgets the difference
between his subject and himself; he is <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>too often a
common graveyard mason that would play the sculptor.&nbsp; And it
is not nearly enough for him to be a decent craftsman.&nbsp; To
give an adequate idea of an artist&rsquo;s work a man must be
himself an artist of equal force and versatility with his
original.&nbsp; The typical translator makes clever enough
verses, but Heine&rsquo;s accomplishment is remote from him as
Heine&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; He perverts his author as rhyme and
rhythm will.&nbsp; No charge of verbal inaccuracy need therefore
be made, for we do not expect a literal fidelity in our
workman.&nbsp; Let him convey the spirit of his original, and
that, so far as meaning goes, is enough.&nbsp; But we do expect
of him a something that shall recall his author&rsquo;s form, his
author&rsquo;s personality, his author&rsquo;s charm of diction
and of style; and here it is that such an interpreter as Sir
Theodore Martin (say) fails with such assurance and
ill-fortune.&nbsp; The movement of Heine&rsquo;s rhythms, simple
as they seem, is not spontaneous; it is an effect of art: the
poet laboured at his cadences as at his meanings.&nbsp;
Artificial he is, but he has the wonderful quality of never
seeming artificial.&nbsp; His verses dance and sway like the
nixies he loved.&nbsp; Their every motion seems informed with the
perfect suavity and spontaneity of pure nature.&nbsp; They tinkle
down the air like sunset bells, they float like clouds, they wave
like flowers, they twitter like skylarks, they have in them
something of the swiftness and the certainty of exquisite <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>physical sensations.&nbsp; In such a transcript as Sir
Theodore&rsquo;s all this is lost: Heine becomes a mere
prentice-metrist; he sets the teeth on edge as surely as Browning
himself; the verse that recalled a dance of naiads suggests a
springless cart on a Highland road; Terpsichore is made to prance
a hobnailed breakdown.&nbsp; The poem disappears, and in its
place you have an indifferent copy of verses.&nbsp; You look at
the pages from afar, and your impression is that they are not
unlike Heine; you look into them, and Heine has vanished.&nbsp;
The man is gone, and only an awkward, angular, clumsily
articulated, entirely preposterous lay-figure remains to show
that the translator has been by.</p>
<h2><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>MATTHEW ARNOLD</h2>
<h3>His Verse.</h3>
<p>In every page of Arnold the poet there is something to return
upon and to admire.&nbsp; There are faults, and these of a kind
this present age is ill-disposed to condone.&nbsp; The rhymes are
sometimes poor; the movement of the verse is sometimes uncertain
and sometimes slow; the rhythms are obviously simple always; now
and then the intention and effect are cold even to austerity, are
bald to uncomeliness.&nbsp; But then, how many of the rarer
qualities of art and inspiration are represented here, and here
alone in modern work!&nbsp; There is little of that delight in
material for material&rsquo;s sake which is held to be essential
to the composition of a great artist; there is none of that
rapture of sound and motion and none of that efflorescence of
expression which are deemed inseparable from the endowment of the
true singer.&nbsp; For any of those excesses in technical
accomplishment, those ecstasies in the use of words, those
effects of sound which are so rich and strange as to impress the
hearer with something of their author&rsquo;s own emotion of
creation&mdash;for any, indeed, of the characteristic attributes
of modern poetry&mdash;you shall <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>turn to him
in vain.&nbsp; In matters of form this poet is no romantic but a
classic to the marrow.&nbsp; He adores his Shakespeare, but he
will none of his Shakespeare&rsquo;s fashions.&nbsp; For him the
essentials are dignity of thought and sentiment and distinction
of manner and utterance.&nbsp; It is no aim of his to talk for
talking&rsquo;s sake, to express what is but half felt and half
understood, to embody vague emotions and nebulous fancies in
language no amount of richness can redeem from the reproach of
being nebulous and vague.&nbsp; In his scheme of art there is no
place for excess, however magnificent and Shakespearean&mdash;for
exuberance, however overpowering and Hugoesque.&nbsp; Human and
interesting in themselves, the ideas apparelled in his verse are
completely apprehended; natural in themselves, the experiences he
pictures are intimately felt and thoroughly perceived.&nbsp; They
have been resolved into their elements by the operation of an
almost Sophoclean faculty of selection, and the effect of their
presentation is akin to that of a gallery of Greek marbles.</p>
<h3>His Failure.</h3>
<p>Other poets say anything&mdash;say everything that is in
them.&nbsp; Browning lived to realise the myth of the
Inexhaustible Bottle; Mr. William Morris is nothing: if not
fluent and copious; Mr. Swinburne has a facility that would seem
impossible if it were not a living <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>fact; even
the Laureate is sometimes prodigal of unimportant details, of
touches insignificant and superfluous, of words for words&rsquo;
sake, of cadences that have no reason of being save
themselves.&nbsp; Matthew Arnold alone says only what is worth
saying.&nbsp; In other words, he selects: from his matter
whatever is impertinent is eliminated and only what is vital is
permitted to remain.&nbsp; Sometimes he goes a little astray, and
his application of the principle on which Sophocles and Homer
wrought results in failure.&nbsp; But in these instances it will
always be found, I think, that the effect is due not to the
principle nor the poet&rsquo;s application of it but to the poet
himself, who has exceeded his commission, and attempted more than
is in him to accomplish.&nbsp; The case is rare with Arnold, one
of whose qualities&mdash;and by no means the least Hellenic of
them&mdash;was a fine consciousness of his limitations.&nbsp; But
that he failed, and failed considerably, it were idle to
deny.&nbsp; There is <i>Merope</i> to bear witness to the fact;
and of <i>Merope</i> what is there to say?&nbsp; Evidently it is
an imitation Greek play: an essay, that is, in a form which
ceased long since to have any active life, so that the attempt to
revive it&mdash;to create a soul under the ribs of very musty
death&mdash;is a blunder alike in sentiment and in art.&nbsp; As
evidently Arnold is no dramatist.&nbsp; Empedocles, the Strayed
Reveller, even the Forsaken Merman, all these are expressions of
purely personal feeling&mdash;are so many <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>metamorphoses
of Arnold.&nbsp; In <i>Merope</i> there is no such basis of
reality.&nbsp; The poet was never on a level with his
argument.&nbsp; He knew little or nothing of his
characters&mdash;of Merope or &AElig;pytus or Polyphontes, of
Arcas or Laias or even the Messenger; at every step the ground is
seen shifting under his feet; he is comparatively void of matter,
and his application of the famous principle is labour lost.&nbsp;
He is winnowing the wind; he is washing not gold but water.</p>
<h3>His Triumphs.</h3>
<p>It is other-guess work with <i>Empedocles</i>, the
<i>Dejaneira</i> fragment, <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>, the
<i>Philomela</i>, his better work in general, above all with the
unique and unapproached <i>Balder Dead</i>.&nbsp; To me this last
stands alone in modern art for simple majesty of conception,
sober directness and potency of expression, sustained dignity of
thought and sentiment and style, the complete presentation of
whatever is essential, the stern avoidance of whatever is merely
decorative: indeed for every Homeric quality save rhythmical
vitality and rapidity of movement.&nbsp; Here, for example, is
something of that choice yet ample suggestiveness&mdash;the only
true realism because the only perfect ideal of
realisation&mdash;for which the <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>similitudes
of the &lsquo;Ionian father of his race&rsquo; are pre-eminently
distinguished:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers<br />
Brushes across a tired traveller&rsquo;s face<br />
Who shuffles through the deep dew-moistened dust<br />
On a May evening, in the darken&rsquo;d lanes,<br />
And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by&mdash;<br />
So Hoder brushed by Hermod&rsquo;s side.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is Homer&rsquo;s direct and moving because most human and
comprehensive touch in narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin
rose,<br />
The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;<br />
And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode<br />
To Asgard.&nbsp; And the stars came out in heaven,<br />
High over Asgard, to light home the king.<br />
But fiercely Odin gallop&rsquo;d, moved in heart;<br />
And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came.<br />
And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang<br />
Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,<br />
And the Gods trembled on their golden beds<br />
Hearing the wrathful Father coming home&mdash;<br />
For dread, for like a whirlwind Odin came.<br />
And to Valhalla&rsquo;s gate he rode, and left<br />
Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;<br />
And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&mdash;to have done with evidence of what is known to
every one&mdash;here is the Homeric mariner, large and majestic
and impersonal, of recording speech:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Bethink ye, Gods, is there no other
way?&mdash;<br />
Speak, were not this a way, a way for Gods?<br />
If I, if Odin, clad in radiant arms,<br />
Mounted on Sleipner, with the warrior Thor<br />
Drawn in his car beside me, and my sons,<br />
All the strong brood of Heaven, to swell my train,<br />
Should make irruption into Hela&rsquo;s realm,<br />
And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light,<br />
And bring in triumph Balder back to Heaven?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>One has but to contrast such living work as this with
the &lsquo;mouldering realm&rsquo; of <i>Merope</i> to feel the
difference with a sense of pain;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For doleful are the ghosts, the troops of
dead,<br />
Whom Hela with austere control presides&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while this in its plain, heroic completeness is touched with a
stately life that is a presage of immortality.&nbsp; It is
evident, indeed, that Arnold wrote <i>Balder Dead</i> in his most
fortunate hour, and that <i>Merope</i> is his one serious mistake
in literature.&nbsp; For a genius thus peculiar and introspective
drama&mdash;the presentation of character through action&mdash;is
impossible; to a method thus reticent and severe drama&mdash;the
expression of emotion in action&mdash;is improper.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not here, O Apollo!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is written that none
shall bind his brows with the twin laurels of epos and
drama.&nbsp; Shakespeare did not, nor could Homer; and how should
Matthew Arnold?</p>
<h3>His Prose.</h3>
<p>He has opinions and the courage of them; he has assurance and
he has charm; he writes with an engaging clearness.&nbsp; It is
very possible to disagree with him; but it is difficult indeed to
resist his many graces of manner, and decline to be entertained
and even interested by the variety and quality of his <!-- page
89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>matter.&nbsp; He was described as &lsquo;the most
un-English of Britons,&rsquo; the most cosmopolitan of islanders;
and you feel as you read him that in truth his mind was
French.&nbsp; He took pattern by Goethe, and was impressed by
Leopardi; he was judiciously classic, but his romanticism was
neither hidebound nor inhuman; he apprehended Heine and Marcus
Aurelius, Spinoza and Sainte-Beuve, Joubert and Maurice de
Gu&eacute;rin, Wordsworth and Pascal, Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt,
Burke and Arthur Clough, Eliza Cook and Homer; he was an
authority on education, poetry, civilisation, the <i>Song of
Roland</i>, the love-letters of Keats, the Genius of Bottles, the
significance of <i>eutrapelos</i> and <i>eutrapelia</i>.&nbsp; In
fact, we have every reason to be proud of him.&nbsp; For the
present is a noisy and affected age; it is given overmuch to
clamorous devotion and extravagant repudiation; there is an
element of swagger in all its words and ways; it has a
distressing and immoral turn for publicity.&nbsp; Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s function was to protest against its fashions by
his own intellectual practice, and now and then to take it to
task and to call it to order.&nbsp; He was not particularly
original, but he had in an eminent degree the formative capacity,
the genius of shaping and developing, which is a chief quality of
the French mind and which is not so common among us English as
our kindest critics would have us believe.&nbsp; He would take a
handful of golden sentences&mdash;things wisely thought and
finely said <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>by persons having authority&mdash;and
spin them into an exquisite prelection; so that his work with all
the finish of art retains a something of the freshness of those
elemental truths on which it was his humour to dilate.&nbsp; He
was, that is to say, an artist in ethics as in speech, in culture
as in ambition.&nbsp; &lsquo;Il est donn&eacute;,&rsquo; says
Sainte-Beuve, &lsquo;de nos jours, &agrave; un bien petit nombre,
m&ecirc;me parmi les plus d&eacute;licats et ceux qui les
appr&eacute;cient le mieux, de recueillir, d&rsquo;ordonner sa
vie selon ses admirations et selon ses go&ucirc;ts, avec suite,
avec noblesse.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is true enough; but Arnold was
one of the few, and might &lsquo;se vanter d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre
rest&eacute; fid&egrave;le &agrave; soi-m&ecirc;me, &agrave; son
premier et &agrave; son plus beau pass&eacute;.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
was always a man of culture in the good sense of the word; he had
many interests in life and art, and his interests were sound and
liberal; he was a good critic of both morals and measures, both
of society and of literature, because he was commonly at the
pains of understanding his matter before he began to speak about
it.&nbsp; It is therefore not surprising that the part he played
was one of considerable importance or that his influence was
healthy in the main.&nbsp; He was neither prophet nor pedagogue
but a critic pure and simple.&nbsp; Too well read to be violent,
too nice in his discernment to be led astray beyond recovery in
any quest after strange gods, he told the age its faults and
suggested such remedies as the study of great men&rsquo;s work
<!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>had suggested to him.&nbsp; If his effect was little
that was not his fault.&nbsp; He returned to the charge with
imperturbable good temper, and repeated his remarks&mdash;which
are often exasperating in effect&mdash;with a mixture of
mischievousness and charm, of superciliousness and sagacity, and
a serene dexterity of phrase, unique in modern letters.</p>

92</span>HOMER AND THEOCRITUS</h2>
<h3>The Odyssey.</h3>
<p>I think that of all recent books the two that have pleased me
best and longest are those delightful renderings into English
prose of the Greek of Homer and Theocritus, which we owe, the one
to Messrs. Henry Butcher and Andrew Lang and the other to Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s unaided genius.&nbsp; To read this <i>Odyssey</i> of
theirs is to have a breath of the clear, serene airs that blew
through the antique Hellas; to catch a glimpse of the large, new
morning light that bathes the seas and highlands of the young
heroic world.&nbsp; In a space of shining and fragrant clarity
you have a vision of marble columns and stately cities, of men
august in single-heartedness and strength and women comely and
simple and superb as goddesses; and with a music of leaves and
winds and waters, of plunging ships and clanging armours, of
girls at song and kindly gods discoursing, the sunny-eyed heroic
age is revealed in all its nobleness, in all its majesty, its
candour, and its charm.&nbsp; The air is yet plangent with echoes
of the leaguer of Troy, and Odysseus the ready-at-need goes forth
upon his wanderings: into the cave of Polypheme, into the land of
giants, <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>into the very regions of the dead: to
hear among the olive trees the voice of Circe, the sweet witch,
singing her magic song as she fares to and fro before her golden
loom; to rest and pine in the islet of Calypso, the kind
sea-goddess; to meet with Nausicaa, loveliest of mortal maids; to
reach his Ithaca, and do battle with the Wooers, and age in peace
and honour by the side of the wise Penelope.&nbsp; The day is yet
afar when, as he sailed out to the sunset and the mysterious
west,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sol con un legno, e con quella compagna<br />
Picciola, dalla qual non fue deserto,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the great wind rushed upon him from the new-discovered land,
and so ended his journeyings for ever; and all with him is energy
and tact and valour and resource, as becomes the captain of an
indomitable human soul.&nbsp; His society is like old
d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s: it invigorates, renews, inspires.&nbsp;
I had rather lack the friendship of the good Alonso Quijada
himself than the brave example of these two.</p>
<h3>The Idylls.</h3>
<p>With certain differences it is the same with our
Theocritus.&nbsp; From him, too, the mind is borne back to a
&lsquo;happier age of gold,&rsquo; when the world was younger
than now, and men were not so weary nor so jaded nor so highly
civilised as they choose to think <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>themselves.&nbsp; Shepherds still piped, and maidens
still listened to their piping.&nbsp; The old gods had not been
discrowned and banished; and to fishers drawing their nets the
coasts yet kept a something of the trace of amorous Polypheme,
the rocks were peopled with memories of his plaint to
Galatea.&nbsp; Inland, among the dim and thymy woods, bee-haunted
and populous with dreams of dryad and oread, there were rumours
of Pan; and dwellers under thatch&mdash;the goatherd mending his
sandals, the hind carving his new staff, the girls who busked
them for the vintaging&mdash;were conscious, as the wind went by
among the beeches and the pines, and brought with it the sounds
of a lonely and mysterious night, that hard by them in the starry
darkness the divine Huntress was abroad, and about the base of
&AElig;tna she and her forest maids drove the chase with horn and
hound.&nbsp; In the cities ladies sang the psalm of Adonis
brought back from &lsquo;the stream eternal of
Acheron.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under the mystic moon love-lorn damsels did
their magic rites, and knit up spells of power to bring home the
men they loved.&nbsp; Among the vines and under the grey olives
songs were singing of Daphnis all day long.&nbsp; There were
junketings and dancings and harvest-homes for ever toward; the
youths went by to the gymnasium, and the girls stood near to
watch them as they went; the cicalas sang, the air was fragrant
with apples and musical with the sound of flutes and running
water; while <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the blue Sicilian sky laughed over
all, and the soft Sicilian sea encircled the land and its lovers
with a ring of sapphire and silver.&nbsp; To translate
Theocritus, wrote Sainte-Beuve, is as if one sought to carry away
in one&rsquo;s hand a patch of snow that has lain forgotten
through the summer in a cranny of the rocks of
&AElig;tna:&mdash;&lsquo;On a fait trois pas &agrave; peine, que
cette neige d&eacute;j&agrave; est fondue.&nbsp; On est heureux
s&rsquo;il en reste assez du moins pour donner le vif sentiment
de la fra&icirc;cheur.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Lang has so rendered
into English the graces of the loveliest of Dorian singers that
he has earned the thanks of every lover of true literature.&nbsp;
Every one should read his book, for it will bring him face to
face with a very prince among poets and with a very summer among
centuries.&nbsp; That Theocritus was a rare and beautiful master
there is even in this English transcript an abundance of
evidence.&nbsp; Melancholy apart, he was the Watteau of the old
Greek world&mdash;an exquisite artist, a rare poet, a true and
kindly soul; and it is very good to be with him.&nbsp; We have
changed it all of course, and are as fortunate as we can
expect.&nbsp; But it is good to be with Theocritus, for he lets
you live awhile in the happy age and under the happy heaven that
were his.&nbsp; He gives you leave and opportunity to listen to
the tuneful strife of Lacon and Comatas; to witness the duel in
song between Corydon and Battus; to talk of Galatea pelting with
apples the barking dog of her love-lorn Polypheme; <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>under
the whispering elms, to lie drinking with Eucritus and Lycidas by
the altar of Demeter, &lsquo;while she stands smiling by, with
sheaves and poppies in her hand.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Old Lamps and New.</h3>
<p>It is relief unspeakable to turn from the dust and din and
chatter of modern life, with its growing trade in heroes and its
poverty of men, its innumerable regrets and ambitions and
desires, to this immense tranquillity, this candid and shining
calm.&nbsp; They had no Irish Question then, you can reflect, nor
was theology invented.&nbsp; Men were not afraid of life nor
ashamed of death; and you could be heroic without a dread of
clever editors, and hospitable without fear of rogues, and
dutiful for no hope of illuminated scrolls.&nbsp; Odysseus
disguised as Irus is still Odysseus and august.&nbsp; How comes
it that Mr. Gladstone in rags and singing ballads would be only
fit for a police-station? that Lord Salisbury hawking cocoa-nuts
would instantly suggest the purlieus of Petticoat Lane?&nbsp; Is
the fault in ourselves?&nbsp; Can it be that we have deteriorated
so much as that?&nbsp; Nerves, nerves, nerves! . . .&nbsp; These
many centuries the world has had neuralgia; and what has come of
it is that Robert Elsmere is an ideal, and the bleat of the
sentimentalist might almost be mistaken for the voice of living
England.</p>

97</span>RABELAIS</h2>
<h3>His Essence.</h3>
<p>Rabelais is not precisely a book for bachelors and
maids&mdash;at times, indeed, is not a book for grown men.&nbsp;
There are passages not to be read without a blush and a sensation
of sickness: the young giant which is the Renaissance being
filthy and gross as Nature herself at her grossest and her most
filthy.&nbsp; It is argued that this is all deliberate&mdash;is
an effect of premeditation: that Rabelais had certain home-truths
to deliver to his generation, and delivered them in such terms as
kept him from the fagot and the rope by bedaubing him with the
renown of a common buffoon.&nbsp; But the argument is none of the
soundest in itself, and may fairly be set aside as a piece of
desperate special pleading, the work of counsel at their
wits&rsquo; end for matter of defence.&nbsp; For Rabelais clean
is not Rabelais at all.&nbsp; His grossness is an essential
component in his mental fabric, an element in whose absence he
would be not Rabelais but somebody else.&nbsp; It inspires his
practice of art to the full as thoroughly as it informs his
theory of language.&nbsp; He not only employs it wherever it
might be useful: he goes out of his way to find it, he shovels it
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>in on any and every occasion, he bemerds his readers and
himself with a gusto that assuredly is not a common
characteristic of defensive operations.&nbsp; In him, indeed, the
humour of Old France&mdash;the broad, rank, unsavoury <i>esprit
gaulois</i>&mdash;found its heroic expression; he made use of it
because he must; and we can no more eliminate it from his work
than we can remove the quality of imagination from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s or those of art and intellect from Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Other men are as foul or fouler; but in
none is foulness so inbred and so ingrained, from none is it so
inseparable.&nbsp; Few have had so much genius, and in none else
has genius been so curiously featured.</p>
<h3>His Secret.</h3>
<p>It is significant enough that with all this against him he
should have been from the first a great moral and literary
influence and the delight of the wisest and soundest minds the
world has seen.&nbsp; Shakespeare read him, and Jonson;
Montaigne, a greater than himself, is in some sort his
descendant; Swift, in Coleridge&rsquo;s enlightening phrase, is
&lsquo;anima Rabelaesii habitans in sicco&rsquo;; to Sterne and
Balzac and Moli&egrave;re he was a constant inspiration; unto
this day his work is <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>studied and his meanings are sought
with almost religious devoutness; while his phrases have passed
into the constitution of a dozen languages, and the great figures
he scrawled across the face of the Renaissance have survived the
movement that gave them being, and are ranked with the monuments
of literature.&nbsp; Himself has given us the reasons in the
prologue to the first book, where he tells of the likeness
between Socrates and the boxes called Sileni, and discourses of
the manifest resemblance of his own work with Socrates.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Opening this box,&rsquo; which is Socrates, says he,
&lsquo;you would have found within it a heavenly and inestimable
drug, a more than human understanding, an admirable virtue,
matchless learning, invincible courage, inimitable sobriety,
certain contentment of mind, perfect assurance, and an incredible
disregard of all that for which men cunningly do so much watch,
run, sail, fight, travel, toil, and turmoil
themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; In such wise must his book be opened,
and the &lsquo;high conceptions&rsquo; with which it is stuffed
will presently be apparent.&nbsp; Nay, more: you are to do with
it even as a dog with a marrowbone.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have seen
him you might have remarked with what devotion and circumspection
he watches and wards it; with what care he keeps it; how
fervently he holds it; how prudently he gobbets it; with what
affection he breaks it; with what diligence he sucks
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>And in the same way you &lsquo;by a
sedulous lecture and frequent meditation&rsquo; shall break the
bone and suck out the marrow of these books.&nbsp; Since the
advice was proffered, generation after generation of mighty wits
have taken counsel with the Master, and his wisdom has through
them been passed out into the practice of life, the evolution of
society, the development of humanity.&nbsp; But the &lsquo;prince
de toute sapience et de toute com&eacute;die&rsquo; has not yet
uttered his last word.&nbsp; He remains in the front of time as
when he lived and wrote.&nbsp; The Abbey of Thelema and the
education of Gargantua are still unrealised ideals; the Ringing
Isle and the Isle of Papimany are in their essentials pretty much
as he left them; Panurge, &lsquo;the pollarded man, the man with
every faculty except the reason,&rsquo; has bettered no whit for
the three centuries of improvement that have passed since he was
flashed into being.&nbsp; We&mdash;even we&mdash;have much to
learn from Master Alcofribas, and until we have learned it well
enough to put it into practice his work remains half done and his
book still one to study.</p>
<h2><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>SHAKESPEARE</h2>
<h3>A Parallel.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare and Rembrandt have in common the faculty of
quickening speculation and compelling the minds of men to combat
and discussion.&nbsp; About the English poet a literature of
contention has been in process of accretion ever since he was
discovered to be Shakespeare; and about the Dutch painter and
etcher there has gradually accumulated a literature precisely
analogous in character and for the most part of equal
quality.&nbsp; In such an age as this, when the creative faculty
of the world is mainly occupied with commentary and criticism,
the reason should not be far to seek.&nbsp; Both were giants;
both were original and individual in the highest sense of the
words; both were leagues ahead of their contemporaries, not
merely as regards the matter of their message but also in respect
of the terms of its delivery; each, moreover&mdash;and here one
comes upon a capital point of contact and resemblance&mdash;each
was at times prodigiously inferior to himself.&nbsp; Shakespeare
often writes so ill that you hesitate to believe he could ever
write supremely well; or, if this way of putting it seem
indecorous and abominable, he very <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>often
writes so well that you are loth to believe he could ever have
written thus extremely ill.&nbsp; There are passages in his work
in which he reaches such heights of literary art as since his
time no mortal has found accessible; and there are passages which
few or none of us can read without a touch of that &lsquo;burning
sense of shame&rsquo; experienced in the presence of Mr.
Poynter&rsquo;s <i>Diadumene</i> by the British Matron of <i>The
Times</i> newspaper.&nbsp; Now, we have got to be so curious in
ideals that we cannot away with the thought of
imperfection.&nbsp; Our worship must have for its object
something flawless, something utterly without spot or
blemish.&nbsp; We can be satisfied with nothing less than an
entire and perfect chrysolite; and we cannot taste our
Shakespeare at his worst without experiencing not merely the
burning sense of shame aforesaid but also a frenzy of longing to
father his faults upon somebody else&mdash;Marlowe for instance,
or Green, or Fletcher&mdash;and a fury of proving that our
divinity was absolutely incapable of them.&nbsp; That Shakespeare
varied&mdash;that the matchless prose and the not particularly
lordly verse of <i>As You Like It</i> are by the same hand; that
the master to whom we owe our Hamlet is also responsible for
Gertrude and King Claudius; that he who gave us the agony of Lear
and the ruin of Othello did likewise perpetrate the scene of
Hector&rsquo;s murder, in manner so poor and in spirit so cynical
and vile&mdash;is beyond all belief and patience; <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>and we have argued the point to such an extent that we
are all of us in Gotham, and a mooncalf like the ascription of
whatever is good in Shakespeare to Lord Bacon is no prodigy but a
natural birth.</p>
<h2><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>SIDNEY</h2>
<h3>His Expression of Life.</h3>
<p>Sidney&rsquo;s prime faults are affectation and conceit.&nbsp;
His verses drip with fine love-honey; but it has been so
clarified in meta-physics that much of its flavour and sweetness
has escaped.&nbsp; Very often, too, the conceit embodied is
preposterously poor.&nbsp; You have as it were a casket of finest
gold elaborately wrought and embellished, and the gem within is a
mere spangle of paste, a trumpery spikelet of crystal.&nbsp; No
doubt there is a man&rsquo;s heart beating underneath; but so
thick is the envelope of buckram and broidery and velvet through
which it has to make itself audible that its pulsations are
sometimes hard to count, while to follow it throb by throb is
impossible.&nbsp; And if this be true of that <i>Astrophel and
Stella</i> series in which the poet outpours the melodious heyday
of his youth&mdash;in which he strives to embody a passion as
rich and full as ever stirred man&rsquo;s blood&mdash;what shall
be said of the <i>Arcadia</i>?&nbsp; In that &lsquo;cold
pastoral&rsquo; he is trying to give breath and substance to as
thin and frigid a fashion as has ever afflicted literature; and
though he put a great deal of himself into the result, still
every one has not the true critical insight, and to most <!--
page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>of us, I think, those glimpses of the lofty nature of
the writer which make the thing written a thing of worth in the
eyes of the few are merely invisible.</p>
<h3>His Fame.</h3>
<p>In thinking of Sidney, Ophelia&rsquo;s lament for Hamlet
springs to the lips, and the heart reverts to that closing scene
at Zutphen with a blessed sadness of admiration and regret.&nbsp;
But frankly, is it not a fact that that fine last speech of his
has more availed to secure him immortality than all his
verse?&nbsp; They call him the English Bayard, and the Frenchman
need not be displeasured by the comparison.&nbsp; But when you
come to read his poetry you find that our Bayard had in him a
strong dash of the pedant and a powerful leaven of the
euphuist.&nbsp; Subtle, delicate, refined, with a keen and
curious wit, a rare faculty of verse, a singular capacity of
expression, an active but not always a true sense of form, he
wrote for the few, and (it may be) the few will always love
him.&nbsp; But his intellectual life, intense though it were, was
lived among shadows and abstractions.&nbsp; He thought deeply,
but he neither looked widely nor listened intently, and when all
is said he remains no more than a brilliant amorist, too
super-subtle for complete sincerity, whose fluency and sweetness
have not improved with years.</p>
<h2><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>TOURNEUR</h2>
<h3>His Style.</h3>
<p>Tourneur was a fierce and bitter spirit.&nbsp; The words in
which he unpacked his heart are vitalised with passion.&nbsp; He
felt so keenly that oftentimes his phrase is the offspring of the
emotion, so terse and vigorous and apt, so vivid and so potent
and eager, it appears.&nbsp; As an instance of this avidity of
wrath and scorn finding expression in words the fittest and most
forcible, leaving the well-known scenes embalmed in Elia&rsquo;s
praise, one might take the three or four single words in which
Vindici (<i>The Revenger&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>), on as many several
occasions, refers to the caresses of Spurio and the wanton
Duchess.&nbsp; Each is of such amazing propriety, is so keenly
discriminated, is so obviously the product of an imagination
burning with rage and hate, that it strikes you like an affront:
each is an incest taken in the fact and branded there and
then.&nbsp; And this quality of verbal fitness, this power of so
charging a phrase with energy and colour as to make it convey the
emotion of the writer at the instant of inspiration, is perhaps
the master quality of Tourneur&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h3><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>His Matter.</h3>
<p>They that would have it are many; they that achieve their
desire are few.&nbsp; For in the minor artist the
passionate&mdash;the elemental quality&mdash;is not often found:
he being of his essence the ape or zany of his betters.&nbsp;
Tourneur is not a great tragic.&nbsp; <i>The Atheist&rsquo;s
Tragedy</i> is but grotesquely and extravagantly horrible; its
personages are caricatures of passion; its comedy is
inexpressibly sordid; its incidents are absurd when they are not
simply abominable.&nbsp; But it is written in excellent dramatic
verse and in a rich and brilliant diction, and it contains a
number of pregnant epithets and ringing lines and violent
phrases.&nbsp; And if you halve the blame and double the praise
you will do something less than justice to that
<i>Revenger&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> which is Tourneur&rsquo;s
immortality.&nbsp; After all its companion is but a bastard of
the loud, malignant, antic muse of Marston; the elegies are cold,
elaborate, and very tedious; the <i>Transformed Metamorphosis</i>
is better verse but harder reading than <i>Sordello</i>
itself.&nbsp; But the <i>Revenger&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> has merit
as a piece of art and therewith a rare interest as a window on
the artist&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The effect is as of a volcanic
landscape.&nbsp; An earthquake has passed, and among grisly
shapes and blasted aspects here lurks and wanders the genius of
ruin.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 108</span>WALTON</h2>
<h3>The Compleat Angler.</h3>
<p>I am told that it is generally though silently admitted that,
while Charles Cotton came of a school of fishermen renowned for
accomplishment even now, his master and friend was not in the
modern or Cottonian sense a fisherman at all.&nbsp; There was in
him, indeed, a vast deal of the philosopher and the observer of
nature and still more, perhaps, of the artist in English; but
there was also not a little of the cockney sportsman.&nbsp; He
never rose above the low-lived worm and quill; his prey was
commonly those fish that are the scorn of the true angler, for he
knew naught of trout and grayling, yet was deeply interested in
such base creatures (and such poor eating) as chub and roach and
dace; and that part of his treatise which has still a certain
authority&mdash;which may be said, indeed, to have placed the
mystery of fly-fishing upon something of a scientific
basis&mdash;was not his work but that of &lsquo;my most honoured
friend, Charles Cotton, Esq.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, it is a
characteristic of your true as opposed to your cockney sportsman
that, unless constrained thereto by hunger, he does not eat what
he has killed; and <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>it is a characteristic of
Walton&mdash;who in this particular at least may stand for the
authentic type of the cockney sportsman as opposed to the true
one&mdash;that he delighted not much less in dining or supping on
his catch than he did in the act of making it: as witness some of
the most charming parts in a book that from one end to the other
is charm and little besides.&nbsp; Indeed the truth&mdash;(with
reverence be it spoken)&mdash;appears to be that the <i>Compleat
Angler</i> is an expression in the terms of art of the
cit&rsquo;s enjoyment of the country.</p>
<h3>Master Piscator.</h3>
<p>What Walton saw in angling was not that delight in the
consciousness of accomplishment and intelligence which sends the
true fisherman to the river and keeps him there, rejoicing in his
strength, whether he kill or go empty away.&nbsp; It was rather
the pretext&mdash;with a worm and perhaps a good supper at one
end and a contemplative man at the other&mdash;of a day in the
fields: where the skylark soared, and the earth smelled sweet,
and the water flashed and tinkled as it ran, while hard by some
milk-maid, courteous yet innocent, sang as she plied her nimble
fingers, and not very far away the casement of the inn-parlour
gleamed comfortable <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>promises of talk and food and
rest.&nbsp; That was the Master Piscator who, being an excellent
man of letters, went out to &lsquo;stretch his legs up Tottenham
Hill&rsquo; in search of fish, and came home with immortal copy;
and that was the Izaak Walton who &lsquo;ventured to fill a
part&rsquo; of Cotton&rsquo;s &lsquo;margin&rsquo; with remarks
not upon his theory of how to angle for trout or grayling in a
clear stream but &lsquo;by way of paraphrase for your
reader&rsquo;s clearer understanding both of the situation of
your fishing house, and the pleasantness of that you dwell
in.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had the purest and the most innocent of
minds, he was the master of a style as bright, as sweet, as
refreshing and delightful, as fine clean home-spun some time in
lavender; he called himself an angler, and he believed in the
description with a cordial simplicity whose appeal is more
persuasive now than ever.&nbsp; But he was nothing if not the
citizen afield&mdash;the cockney aweary of Bow Bells and
rejoicing in &lsquo;the sights and sounds of the open
landscape.&rsquo;&nbsp; After all it is only your town-bred poet
who knows anything of the country, or is moved to concern himself
in anywise for the sensations and experiences it yields.&nbsp;
Milton was born in Bread Street, and Herrick in Cheapside.&nbsp;
Yet Milton gave us the <i>Allegro</i> and the <i>Penseroso</i>
and the scenery in <i>Comus</i> and the epic; while as for
Herrick&mdash;the <i>Night-Piece</i>, the lovely and immortal
verses <i>To Meadows</i>, the fresh yet sumptuous and noble <i>To
Corinna Going a-Maying</i>, <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>these and a
hundred more are there to answer for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; Here
Walton is with Herrick and Milton and many &lsquo;dear sons of
Memory&rsquo; besides; and that is why he not only loved the
country but was moved to make art of it as well.</p>
<h2><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>HERRICK</h2>
<h3>His Muse.</h3>
<p>In Herrick the air is fragrant with new-mown hay; there is a
morning light upon all things; long shadows streak the grass, and
on the eglantine swinging in the hedge the dew lies white and
brilliant.&nbsp; Out of the happy distance comes a shrill and
silvery sound of whetting scythes; and from the near brook-side
rings the laughter of merry maids in circle to make cowslipballs
and babble of their bachelors.&nbsp; As you walk you are
conscious of &lsquo;the grace that morning meadows wear,&rsquo;
and mayhap you meet Amaryllis going home to the farm with an
apronful of flowers.&nbsp; Rounded is she and buxom, cool-cheeked
and vigorous and trim, smelling of rosemary and thyme, with an
appetite for curds and cream and a tongue of &lsquo;cleanly
wantonness.&rsquo;&nbsp; For her singer has an eye in his head,
and exquisite as are his fancies he dwells in no land of
shadows.&nbsp; The more clearly he sees a thing the better he
sings it; and provided that he do see it nothing is beneath the
caress of his muse.&nbsp; The bays and rosemary that wreath the
hall at Yule, the log itself, the Candlemas box, the hock-cart
and the maypole, nay,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;See&rsquo;st thou that cloud as silver
clear,<br />
Plump, soft, and swelling everywhere?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tis Julia&rsquo;s bed!&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>And not only does he listen to the
&lsquo;clecking&rsquo; of his hen and know what it means: he
knows too that the egg she has laid is long and white; so that
ere he enclose it in his verse, you can see him take it in his
hand, and look at it with a sort of boyish wonder and
delight.&nbsp; This freshness of spirit, this charming and
innocent curiosity, he carries into all he does.&nbsp; He can
turn a sugared compliment with the best, but when Amaryllis
passes him by he is yet so eager and unsophisticate that he can
note that &lsquo;winning wave in the tempestuous petticoat&rsquo;
which has rippled to such good purpose through so many graceful
speeches since.&nbsp; So that though Julia and Dianeme and Anthea
have passed away, though Corinna herself is merely &lsquo;a
fable, song, a fleeting shade,&rsquo; he has saved enough of them
from the ravin of Time for us to love and be grateful for
eternally.&nbsp; Their gracious ghosts abide in a peculiar nook
of the Elysium of Poesy.&nbsp; There &lsquo;in their habit as
they lived&rsquo; they dance in round, they fill their laps with
flowers, they frolic and junket sweetly, they go for ever
maying.&nbsp; Soft winds blow round them, and in their clear
young voices they sing the verse of the rare artist who called
them from the multitude and set them for ever where they are.</p>
<h3><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>His Moral.</h3>
<p>And Amaryllis herself will not, mayhap, be found so fair as
those younglings of the year she bears with her in &lsquo;wicker
ark&rsquo; or &lsquo;lawny continent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Herrick is
pre-eminently the poet of flowers.&nbsp; He alone were capable of
bringing back</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Le
bouquet d&rsquo;Oph&eacute;lie<br />
De la rive inconnue o&ugrave; les flots l&rsquo;ont
laiss&eacute;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He knows and loves the dear blossoms all.&nbsp; He considers
them with tender and shining eyes, he culls them his sweetest
fancies and his fondest metaphors.&nbsp; Their idea is
inseparable from that of his girls themselves, and it is by the
means of the one set of mistresses that he is able so well to
understand the other.&nbsp; The flowers are maids to him, and the
maids are flowers.&nbsp; In an ecstasy of tender contemplation he
turns from those to these, exampling Julia from the rose and
pitying the hapless violets as though they were indeed not blooms
insensitive but actually &lsquo;poor girls
neglected.&rsquo;&nbsp; His pages breathe their clean and
innocent perfumes, and are beautiful with the chaste beauty of
their colour, just as they carry with them something of the
sweetness and simplicity of maidenhood itself.&nbsp; And from
both he extracts the same pathetic little moral: both are lovely
and both must die.&nbsp; And so, between his virgins that are for
love indeed and those that sit silent and delicious in the
&lsquo;flowery nunnery,&rsquo; the old singer finds life so good
a thing that he dreads <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to lose it,
and not all his piety can remove the passionate regret with which
he sees things hastening to their end.</p>
<h3>His Piety.</h3>
<p>That piety is equally removed from the erotic mysticism of
Richard Crashaw and from the adoration, chastened and awful and
pure, of Cowper.&nbsp; To find an analogue, you have to cross the
borders of English into Spain.&nbsp; In his <i>Noble Numbers</i>
Herrick shows himself to be a near kinsman of such men as
Valdivielso, Oca&ntilde;a, Lope de Ubeda; and there are versicles
of his that in their homely mixture of the sacred and the
profane, in their reverent familiarity with things divine, their
pious and simple gallantry, may well be likened to the graceful
and charming romances and villancicos of these strangers.&nbsp;
Their spirit is less Protestant than Catholic, and is hardly
English at all, so that it is scarce to be wondered at if they
have remained unpopular.&nbsp; But their sincerity and
earnestness are as far beyond doubt as their grace of line and
inimitable daintiness of surface.</p>
<h2><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>LOCKER</h2>
<h3>His Qualities.</h3>
<p>Mr. Locker&rsquo;s verse has charmed so wisely and so long
that it has travelled the full circle of compliment and exhausted
one part of the lexicon of eulogy.&nbsp; As you turn his pages
you feel as freshly as ever the sweet, old-world elegance, the
courtly amiability, the mannerly restraint, the measured and
accomplished ease.&nbsp; True, they are colourless, and in these
days we are deboshed with colour; but then they are so luminously
limpid and serene, they are so sprightly and graceful and
gay!&nbsp; In the gallantry they affect there is a something at
once exquisite and paternal.&nbsp; If they pun, &rsquo;tis with
an air: even thus might Chesterfield have stooped to folly.&nbsp;
And then, how clean the English, how light yet vigorous the
touch, the manner how elegant and how staid!&nbsp; There is wit
in them, and that so genial and unassuming that as like as not it
gets leave to beam on unperceived.&nbsp; There is humour too, but
humour so polite as to look half-unconscious, so dandified that
it leaves you in doubt as to whether you should laugh or only
smile.&nbsp; And withal there is a vein of well-bred wisdom never
breathed but to the <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>delight no less than to the profit
of the student.&nbsp; And for those of them that are touched with
passion, as in <i>The Unrealized Ideal</i> and that lovely odelet
to Mabel&rsquo;s pearls, why, these are, I think, the best and
the least approachable of all.</p>
<h3>His Effect.</h3>
<p>For as English as she is, indeed, his muse is not to be
touched off save in French.&nbsp; To think of her is to reflect
that she is <i>delicate</i>, <i>spirituelle</i>,
<i>s&eacute;millante</i>&mdash;<i>une fine mouche</i>,
<i>allez</i>!&nbsp; The <i>salon</i> has
disappeared,&mdash;&lsquo;Iran, indeed, is gone, and all his
rose&rsquo;; but she was born with the trick of it.&nbsp; You
make your bow to her in her Sheraton chair, a buckle shoe
engagingly discovered; and she rallies you with an incomparable
ease, a delicate malice, in a dialect itself a distinction; and
when she smiles it is behind or above a fan that points while it
dissembles, that assists effect as delightfully as it veils
intention.&nbsp; At times she is sensitive and tender, but her
graver mood has no more of violence or mawkishness than has her
gallant roguery (or enchanting archness) of viciousness or
spite.&nbsp; Best of all, she is her poet&rsquo;s very own.&nbsp;
You may woo her and pursue her as you will; but the end is
invariable.&nbsp; &lsquo;I follow, follow still, but I shall
never see her face.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even as in her master&rsquo;s
finest song.</p>
<h2><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>BANVILLE</h2>
<h3>His Nature.</h3>
<p>The Muse of M. de Banville was born not naked but in the most
elaborate and sumptuous evening wear that ever muse put on.&nbsp;
To him, indeed, there is no nature so natural as that depicted on
the boards, no humanity half so human as the actor puts on with
his paint.&nbsp; For him the flowers grow plucked and bound into
nosegays; passion has no existence outside the
Porte-Saint-Martin; the universe is a place of rhymes and
rhythms, the human heart a supplement to the dictionary.&nbsp; He
delights in babbling of green fields, and Homer, and Shakespeare,
and the Eumenides, and the &lsquo;<i>rire
&eacute;norme</i>&rsquo; of the <i>Frogs</i> and the
<i>Lysistrata</i>.&nbsp; But it is suspected that he loves these
things rather as words than as facts, and that in his heart of
hearts he is better pleased with Cassandra and Columbine than
with Rosalind and Othello, with the studio Hellas of Gautier than
with the living Greece of Sophocles.&nbsp; Heroic objects are all
very well in their way of course: they suggest superb effects in
verse, they are of incomparable merit considered as colours and
jewels for well-turned sentences in prose.&nbsp; But their
function is <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>purely verbal; they are the raw
material of the outward form of poesy, and they come into being
to glorify a climax, to adorn a refrain, to sparkle and sound in
odelets and rondels and triolets, to twinkle and tinkle and chime
all over the eight-and-twenty members of a fair ballade.</p>
<h3>His Art.</h3>
<p>It is natural enough that to a theory of art and life that can
be thus whimsically described we should be indebted for some of
the best writing of modern years.&nbsp; Our poet has very little
sympathy with fact, whether heroic or the reverse, whether
essential or accidental; but he is a rare artist in words and
cadences.&nbsp; He writes of &lsquo;Pierrot, l&rsquo;homme
subtil,&rsquo; and Columbine, and &lsquo;le beau
L&eacute;andre,&rsquo; and all the marionettes of that pleasant
puppet-show which he mistakes for the world, with the rhetorical
elegance and distinction, the verbal force and glow, the rhythmic
beauty and propriety, of a rare poet; he models a group of
flowers in wax as passionately and cunningly, and with as perfect
an interest in the process and as lofty and august a faith in the
result, as if he were carving the Venus of Milo, or scoring
Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fifth,&rsquo; or producing <i>King
Lear</i> or the <i>Ronde de Nuit</i>.&nbsp; He is profoundly
artificial, but he is simple and even <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>innocent in
his artifice; so that he is often interesting and even
affecting.&nbsp; He knows so well what should be done and so well
how to do it that he not seldom succeeds in doing something that
is actually and veritably art: something, that is, in which there
is substance as well as form, in which the matter is equal with
the manner, in which the imagination is human as well as
&aelig;sthetic and the invention not merely verbal but emotional
and romantic also.&nbsp; The dramatic and poetic value of such
achievements in style as <i>Florise</i> and <i>Diane au Bois</i>
is open to question; but there can be no doubt that
<i>Gringoire</i> is a play.&nbsp; There is an abundance of
&lsquo;epical ennui&rsquo; in <i>le Sang de la Coupe</i> and
<i>les Stalactites</i>; but the &lsquo;Nous n&rsquo;irons plus au
bois&rsquo; and the charming epigram in which the poet paints a
processional frieze of Hellenic virgins are high-water marks of
verse.&nbsp; But, indeed, if Pierrot and Columbine were all the
race, and the footlights might only change places with the sun,
then were M. de Banville by way of being a Shakespeare.</p>

<h3>Method and Effect.</h3>
<p>His style has distinction, elegance, urbanity, precision, an
exquisite clarity.&nbsp; Of its kind it is as nearly as possible
perfect.&nbsp; You think of Horace as you read; and you think of
those among our own eighteenth century poets to whom Horace was
an inspiration and an example.&nbsp; The epithet is usually so
just that it seems to have come into being with the noun it
qualifies; the metaphor is mostly so appropriate that it leaves
you in doubt as to whether it suggested the poem or the poem
suggested it; the verb is never in excess of the idea it would
convey; the effect of it all is that &lsquo;something has here
got itself uttered,&rsquo; and for good.&nbsp; Could anything,
for instance, be better, or less laboriously said, than this
poet&rsquo;s remonstrance <i>To an Intrusive Butterfly</i>?&nbsp;
The thing is instinct with delicate observation, so aptly and
closely expressed as to seem natural and living as the facts
observed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I watch you through the garden walks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I watch you <i>float</i> between<br />
The <i>avenues</i> of dahlia stalks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>flicker</i> on the green;<br />
You <i>hover</i> round the garden seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You <i>mount</i>, you <i>waver</i>. . .</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I watch you wayward go;<br />
* * * * *<br />
Before the bust you flaunt and flit&mdash;<br />
* * * * *<br />
You <i>pause</i>, you <i>poise</i>, you <i>circle up</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among my old Japan.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And all the rest of it.&nbsp; The theme is but the vagaries of
a wandering insect; but how just and true is the literary
instinct, how perfect the literary <i>savoir-faire</i>!&nbsp; The
words I have italicised are the only words (it seems) in the
language that are proper to the occasion; and yet how quietly
they are produced, with what apparent unconsciousness they are
set to do their work, how just and how sufficient is their
effect!&nbsp; In writing of this sort there is a certain artistic
good-breeding whose like is not common in these days.&nbsp; We
have lost the secret of it: we are too eager to make the most of
our little souls in art and too ignorant to do the best by them;
too egoistic and &lsquo;individual,&rsquo; too clever and skilful
and well informed, to be content with the completeness of
simplicity.&nbsp; Even the Laureate was once addicted to glitter
for glitter&rsquo;s sake; and with him to keep them in
countenance there is a thousand minor poets whose &lsquo;little
life&rsquo; is merely a giving way to the necessities of what is
after all a condition of intellectual impotence but poorly
redeemed by a habit of artistic swagger.&nbsp; The singer of
Dorothy and Beau Brocade is of another race.&nbsp; He is
&lsquo;the co-mate and brother in exile&rsquo; of Matthew Arnold
and the poet of <i>The Unknown </i><!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span><i>Eros</i>.&nbsp; Alone among modern English bards
they stand upon that ancient way which is the best: attentive to
the pleadings of the Classic Muse, heedful always to give such
thoughts as they may breed no more than their due expression.</p>

<h3>The Critic.</h3>
<p>One of the very few great musicians who have been able to
write their own language with vigour and perspicuity, Berlioz was
for many years among the kings of the feuilleton, among the most
accomplished journalists of the best epoch of the Parisian
press.&nbsp; He had an abundance of wit and humour; his energy
and spirit were inexhaustible; within certain limits he was a
master of expression and style; in criticism as in music he was
an artist to his finger-ends; and if he found writing hard work
what he wrote is still uncommonly easy reading.&nbsp; He is one
of the few&mdash;the very few&mdash;journalists the worth of
whose achievement has been justified by collection and
republication.&nbsp; Louis Veuillot has been weighed in this
balance, and found wanting; and so has Janin prince of
critics.&nbsp; With Berlioz it is otherwise.&nbsp; If you are no
musician he appeals to you as a student of life; if you are
interested in life and music both he is irresistible.&nbsp; The
<i>M&eacute;moires</i> is one of the two or three essays in
artistic biography which may claim equal honours with
Benvenuto&rsquo;s story of himself and his own doings; the two
volumes of correspondence rank with the most interesting <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>epistolary matter of these times; in the
<i>Grotesques</i>, the <i>A Travers Chants</i>, the
<i>Soir&eacute;es de l&rsquo;Orchestre</i> there is enough of fun
and earnest, of fine criticism and diabolical humour, of wit and
fancy and invention, to furnish forth a dozen ordinary critics,
and leave a rich remainder when all&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; These
books have been popular for years; they are popular still; and
the reason is not far to seek.&nbsp; Berlioz was not only a great
musician and a brilliant writer; he was also a very interesting
and original human being.&nbsp; His writings are one expression
of an abnormal yet very natural individuality; and when he speaks
you are sure of something worth hearing and remembering.</p>
<h3>A Prototype.</h3>
<p>Apart from Cellini&rsquo;s ruffianism there are several points
of contact between the two men.&nbsp; Berlioz made the roaring
goldsmith the hero of an opera, and it is not doubtful that he
was in complete sympathy with his subject.&nbsp; In the Frenchman
there is a full measure of the waywardness of temper, the
impatience of authority, the resolute and daring humour, the
passion of worship for what is great in art and of contempt for
what is little and bad, which entered so largely into the
composition of the <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Florentine.&nbsp; There is not much
to choose between the Berlioz of the <i>D&eacute;bats</i>, the
author of the <i>Grotesques de la Musique</i> and the <i>A
Travers Chants</i>, and the Benvenuto who, as Il Lasca writes of
him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Senza alcun ritegno o barbazzale<br />
Delle cose malfatte dicea male.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benvenuto enlarges upon the joys of drawing from the life and
expatiates upon the greatness of Michelangelo in much the same
spirit and with much the same fury of admiration with which
Berlioz descants upon the rapture of conducting an orchestra and
dilates upon the beauty of <i>Divinit&eacute;s du Styx</i> or the
adagio of the so-called <i>Moonlight Sonata</i>.&nbsp; It is
written of Benvenuto, in connection with Vasari&rsquo;s attack
upon that cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore which himself was wont
to call &lsquo;the marvel of beautiful things,&rsquo; that if he
had lived to see the result,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Certo non capirebbe nelle pelle;<br />
<i>E saltando</i>, <i>e correndo</i>, <i>e fulminando</i>,<br />
S&rsquo; andrebbe querelando,<br />
E per tutto gridando ad alta voce<br />
<i>Giorgin d&rsquo;Arezzo meterebbe in croce</i>,<br />
Oggi universalmente<br />
Odiato della gente<br />
<i>Quasi publico ladro e assassino</i>&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you are reminded irresistibly of Berlioz betrampling
Lachnith and the ingenious Castil-Blaze and defending Beethoven
against the destructive pedantry of F&eacute;tis.&nbsp; And, just
as the <i>Vita</i> is invaluable as a personal record of
artist-life <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>in the Italy of the Renaissance, so
are the <i>M&eacute;moires</i> invaluable as a personal record of
the works and ways of musicians in the Paris of the Romantic
revival.&nbsp; Berlioz is revealed in them for one of the race of
the giants.&nbsp; He is the musician of 1830, as Delacroix is the
painter; and his work is as typical and as significant as the
<i>Sardanapale</i> and the <i>Faust</i> lithographs.</p>
<h3>His Theory of Autobiography.</h3>
<p>To read the <i>M&eacute;moires</i> is to feel that in writing
them the great musician deliberately set himself to win the heart
of posterity.&nbsp; He believed in himself, and he believed in
his music: he divined that one day or another he would be
legendary as well as immortal; and he took an infinite deal of
pains to make certain that the ideal which was presently to
represent him in men&rsquo;s minds should be an ideal of which he
could thoroughly approve.&nbsp; It is fair to note that in this
care for the good will and the good word of the future he was not
by any means alone.&nbsp; The <i>romantiques</i>, indeed, were
keen&mdash;from Napoleon downwards&mdash;to make the very best of
themselves.&nbsp; The poet of the <i>L&eacute;gende des
Si&egrave;cles</i>, for example, went early to work to arrange
the story of his life and character at least as carefully as he
composed <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the audiences of his
<i>premi&egrave;res</i>; and he did it with so light a hand, and
with such a sense of the importance of secrecy, that it is even
now by no means so well and widely known as it should be that
<i>Victor Hugo racont&eacute; par un T&eacute;moin de sa Vie</i>
is the work of the hero&rsquo;s wife, and was not only inspired
but may also have been revised and prepared for publication by
the hero himself.&nbsp; Again, the dramatist of <i>Antony</i> and
the novelist of <i>Bragelonne</i> was never so happy as when he
was engaged upon the creation of what he hoped would be the
historical Dumas; he made volume after volume of delightful
reading out of his own impressions and adventures; he turned
himself into copy with a frankness, a grace, a gusto, a
persistency of egoism, which are merely enchanting.&nbsp;
Berlioz, therefore, had good warrant for his work.&nbsp; It is
more to the point, perhaps, that he would have taken it if he had
not had it.&nbsp; And I hold that he would have done well; for
(in any case) a great man&rsquo;s notion of himself is, <i>ipso
facto</i>, better and more agreeable and convincing, especially
as he presents it, than the idea of his inferiors and admirers,
especially as presented by them.&nbsp; Berlioz, it is true, was
prodigal in these <i>M&eacute;moires</i> of his of wit and fun
and devilry, of fine humanity and noble art, of good things said
and great things dreamed and done and suffered; but he was
prodigal of invention and suppression as well, and the result,
while considerably less veracious, is all the more fascinating,
<!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>therefor.&nbsp; One feels that for one thing he was too
complete an artist to be merely literal and exact; that for
another he saw and felt things for himself, as Milton did before
him&mdash;Milton in the mind&rsquo;s eye of Milton the noblest of
created things and to Mr. Saintsbury almost as unpleasing a
spectacle as the gifted but abject Racine; and for a third that
from his own point of view he was right, and there is an end of
it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>GEORGE ELIOT</h2>
<h3>The Ideal.</h3>
<p>It was thought that with George Eliot the Novel-with-a-Purpose
had really come to be an adequate instrument for the regeneration
of humanity.&nbsp; It was understood that Passion only survived
to point a moral or provide the materials of an awful tale, while
Duty, Kinship, Faith, were so far paramount as to govern Destiny
and mould the world.&nbsp; A vague, decided flavour of Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity was felt to pervade the moral universe,
a chill but seemly halo of Golden Age was seen to play soberly
about things in general.&nbsp; And it was with confidence
anticipated that those perfect days were on the march when men
and women would propose&mdash;(from the austerest
motives)&mdash;by the aid of scientific terminology.</p>
<h3>The Real.</h3>
<p>To the Sceptic&mdash;(an apostate, and an undoubted
male)&mdash;another view was preferable.&nbsp; He held that
George Eliot had carried what he called the
&lsquo;Death&rsquo;s-Head Style&rsquo; of art a trifle too
far.&nbsp; He read her books in much the same spirit and to much
the same <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>purpose that he went to the
gymnasium and diverted himself with parallel bars.&nbsp; He
detested her technology; her sententiousness revolted while it
amused him; and when she put away her puppets and talked of them
learnedly and with understanding&mdash;instead of letting them
explain themselves, as several great novelists have been content
to do&mdash;he recalled how Wisdom crieth out in the street and
no man regardeth her, and perceived that in this case the fault
was Wisdom&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; He accepted with the humility of
ignorance, and something of the learner&rsquo;s gratitude, her
woman generally, from Romola down to Mrs. Pullet.&nbsp; But his
sense of sex was strong enough to make him deny the possibility
in any stage of being of nearly all the governesses in revolt it
pleased her to put forward as men; for with very few exceptions
he knew they were heroes of the divided skirt.&nbsp; To him
Deronda was an incarnation of woman&rsquo;s rights; Tito an
&lsquo;improper female in breeches&rsquo;; Silas Marner a good,
perplexed old maid, of the kind of whom it is said that they have
&lsquo;had a disappointment.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Lydgate alone had
aught of the true male principle about him.</p>
<h3>Appreciations.</h3>
<p>Epigrams are at best half-truths that look like whole
ones.&nbsp; Here is a handful about George <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Eliot.&nbsp; It has been said of her
books&mdash;(&lsquo;on several occasions&rsquo;)&mdash;that
&lsquo;it is doubtful whether they are novels disguised as
treatises, or treatises disguised as novels&rsquo;; that,
&lsquo;while less romantic than Euclid&rsquo;s Elements, they are
on the whole a great deal less improving reading&rsquo;; and that
&lsquo;they seem to have been dictated to a plain woman of genius
by the ghost of David Hume.&rsquo;&nbsp; Herself, too, has been
variously described: as &lsquo;An Apotheosis of
Pupil-Teachery&rsquo;; as &lsquo;George Sand <i>plus</i> Science
and <i>minus</i> Sex&rsquo;; as &lsquo;Pallas with prejudices and
a corset&rsquo;; as &lsquo;the fruit of a caprice of Apollo for
the Differential Calculus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The comparison of her
admirable talent to &lsquo;not the imperial violin but the grand
ducal violoncello&rsquo; seems suggestive and is not unkind.</p>
<h2><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>BORROW</h2>
<h3>His Vocation.</h3>
<p>Three hundred years since Borrow would have been a gentleman
adventurer: he would have dropped quietly down the river, and
steered for the Spanish Main, bent upon making carbonadoes of
your Don.&nbsp; But he came too late for that, and falling upon
no sword and buckler age but one that was interested in Randal
and Spring, he accepted that he found, and did his best to turn
its conditions, into literature.&nbsp; As he had that admirable
instinct of making the best of things which marks the true
adventurer, he was on the whole exceeding happy.&nbsp; There was
no more use in sailing for Javan and Gadire; but at home there
were highways in abundance, and what is your genuine tramp but a
dry-land sailor?&nbsp; The Red Man is exhausted of everything but
sordidness; but under that round-shouldered little tent at the
bend of the road, beside that fire artistically built beneath
that kettle of the comfortable odours, among those horses and
colts at graze hard by, are men and women more mysterious and
more alluring to the romantic mind than any Mingo or Comanch that
ever traded a scalp.&nbsp; While as for your tricks <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>of
fence&mdash;your immortal <i>passado</i>, your <i>punto
reverso</i>&mdash;if that be no longer the right use for a
gentleman, have not Spring and Langan fought their great battle
on Worcester racecourse? and has not Cribb of
Gloucestershire&mdash;that renowned, heroic, irresistible
Thomas&mdash;beaten Molyneux the negro artist in the presence of
twenty thousand roaring Britons? and shall the practice of an art
which has rejoiced in such a master as the illustrious Game
Chicken, Hannibal of the Ring, be held degrading by an Englishman
of sufficient inches who, albeit a Tory and a High Churchman, is
at bottom as thoroughgoing a Republican as ever took the word of
command from Colonel Cromwell?&nbsp; And if all this fail, if he
get nobody to put on the gloves with him, if the tents of the
Romany prove barren of interest, if the king&rsquo;s highway be
vacant of adventure as Mayfair, he has still philology to fall
back upon, he can still console himself with the study of strange
tongues, he can still exult in a peculiar superiority by quoting
the great Ab Gwylim where the baser sort of persons is content
with Shakespeare.&nbsp; So that what with these and some kindred
diversions&mdash;a little horse-whispering and ale-drinking, the
damnation of Popery, the study of the Bible&mdash;he can manage
not merely to live but to live so fully and richly as to be the
envy of some and the amazement of all.&nbsp; That, as life goes
and as the world wags, is given to few.&nbsp; <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Add to it
the credit of having written as good a book about Spain as ever
was written in any language, the happiness of having dreamed and
partly lived that book ere it was written, the perfect joy of
being roundly abused by everybody, and the consciousness of being
different from everybody and of giving at least as good as ever
you got at several things the world is silly enough to hold in
worship&mdash;as the Toryism of Sir Walter, or the niceness of
Popery, or the pleasures of Society: and is it not plain that
Borrow was a man uncommon fortunate, and that he enjoyed life as
greatly as most men not savages who have possessed the fruition
of this terrestrial sphere?</p>
<h3>Ideals and Achievements.</h3>
<p>He prepared his effects as studiously and almost as
dexterously as Dumas himself.&nbsp; His instinct of the
picturesque was rarely indeed at fault; he marshalled his
personages and arranged his scene with something of that passion
for effect which entered so largely into the theory of M. le
Comte de Monte-Cristo.&nbsp; However closely disguised, himself
is always the heroic figure, and he is ever busy in arranging
discovery and triumph.&nbsp; To his chance-mates he is but an
eccentric person, an amateur tinker, a slack-baked gipsy, an
unlettered hack; to his audience he is his <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>own,
strong, indifferent self: presently the rest will recognise him
and he will be disdainfully content.&nbsp; And recognise him they
do.&nbsp; He throws off his disguise; there is a gape, a stare, a
general conviction that Lavengro is the greatest man in the
world; and then&mdash;as the manner of Lesage commands&mdash;the
adventure ends, the stars resume their wonted courses, and the
self-conscious Tinker-Quixote takes the road once more and passes
on to other achievements: a mad preacher to succour, a priest to
baffle, some tramp to pound into a jelly of humility, an
applewoman to mystify, a horse-chaunter to swindle, a pugilist to
study and help and portray.&nbsp; But whatever it be, Lavengro
emerges from the ordeal modestly, unobtrusively, quietly, most
consciously magnificent.&nbsp; Circumstantial as Defoe, rich in
combinations as Lesage, and with such an instinct of the
picturesque, both personal and local, as none of these possessed,
this strange wild man holds on his strange wild way, and leads
you captive to the end.&nbsp; His dialogue is copious and
appropriate: you feel that like Ben Jonson he is dictating rather
than reporting, that he is less faithful and exact than
imaginative and determined; but you are none the less pleased
with it, and suspicious though you be that the voice is
Lavengro&rsquo;s and the hands are the hands of some one else,
you are glad to surrender to the illusion, and you regret when it
is dispelled.&nbsp; Moreover, that all of it <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>should be
set down in racy, nervous, idiomatic English, with a kind of
eloquence at once primitive and scholarly, precious but
homely&mdash;the speech of an artist in sods and turfs&mdash;if
at first it surprise and charm yet ends by seeming so natural and
just that you go on to forget all about it and accept the whole
thing as the genuine outcome of a man&rsquo;s experience which it
purports to be.&nbsp; Add that it is all entirely unsexual; that
there is none with so poor an intelligence of the heart as woman
moves it; that the book does not exist in which the relations
between boy and girl are more miserably misrepresented than in
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>; that that picaresque
ideal of romance which, finding utterance in Hurtado de Mendoza,
was presently to appeal to such artists as Cervantes, Quevedo,
Lesage, Smollett, the Dickens of <i>Pickwick</i>, finds such
expression in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> as
nowhere else; and the tale of Borrow is complete enough.</p>
<h3>Himself.</h3>
<p>Despite or because of a habit of mystification which obliged
him to jumble together the homely Real and a not less homely
Ideal, Lavengro will always, I think, be found worthy of
companionship, if only as the one exemplary artist-tramp the race
has yet achieved.&nbsp; The artist-tramp, the tinker who <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>can write, the horse-coper with a twang of Hamlet and a
habit of Monte-Cristo&mdash;that is George Borrow.&nbsp; For them
that love these differences there is none in whom they are so
cunningly and quaintly blended as George Borrow; and they that
love them not may keep the other side of the road and fare in
peace elsewhither.</p>
<h2><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>BALZAC</h2>
<h3>Under which King?</h3>
<p>To Goethe it seemed that every one of Balzac&rsquo;s novels
had been dug out of a suffering woman&rsquo;s heart: but Goethe
spoke not always wisely, and in this exacting world there be some
that not only have found fault with Balzac&rsquo;s method and
results but have dared to declare his theory of society the dream
of a mind diseased.&nbsp; To these critics Balzac was less
observer than creator: his views were false, his vision was
distorted, and though he had &lsquo;incomparable power&rsquo; he
had not power enough to make them accept his work.&nbsp; This
theory is English, and in France they find Balzac possible
enough.&nbsp; There is something of him in Pierre Dupont; he made
room for the work of Flaubert, Feydeau, the younger Dumas, Augier
and Zola and the brothers Goncourt; and to him Charles Baudelaire
is as some fat strange fungus to the wine-cask in whose leakings
it springs.&nbsp; Sainte-Beuve refused to accept him, but his
&lsquo;Pigault-Lebrun des duchesses&rsquo; is only malicious: he
resented the man&rsquo;s exuberant and inordinate personality,
and made haste to apply to it some drops <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>of that
sugared vitriol of which he had the secret.&nbsp; Taine is a
fitter critic of the <i>Com&eacute;die humaine</i> than
Sainte-Beuve; and Taine has come to other conclusions.&nbsp;
Acute, coarse, methodical, exhaustive, he has recognised the
greatness of one still more exhaustive, methodical, coarse, and
acute than himself.&nbsp; English critics fall foul of
Balzac&rsquo;s women; but Taine falls foul of English critics,
and with the authority of a Parisian by profession declares that
the <i>Parisiennes</i> of the <i>Com&eacute;die</i> are
everything they ought to be&mdash;the true daughters of their
&lsquo;bon gros libertin de p&egrave;re.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while
Taine, exulting in his Marneffe and his Coralie, does solemnly
and brilliantly show that he is right and everybody else is
wrong, a later writer&mdash;English of course&mdash;can find no
better parallel of Balzac than Browning, and knows nothing in art
so like the Pauline of <i>la Peau de Chagrin</i> as the Sistine
Madonna.&nbsp; It is curious, this clash of opinions; and it is
plain that one or other party must be wrong.&nbsp; Which is
it?&nbsp; &lsquo;Qui trompe-t-on ici?&rsquo;&nbsp; Is Taine a
better judge than Mr. Leslie Stephen or Mr. Henry James?&nbsp; Or
are Messrs. James and Stephen better qualified to speak with
authority than Taine?&nbsp; It may be that none but a Frenchman
can thoroughly and intimately apprehend in its inmost a thing so
essentially French as the <i>Com&eacute;die</i>; it is a fact
that Frenchmen of all sorts and sizes have accepted the
<i>Com&eacute;die</i> in its totality; and that is reason good
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>enough for any commonplace Englishman who is lacking in
the vanity of originality to accept it also.</p>
<h3>The Fact.</h3>
<p>Balzac&rsquo;s ambition was to be omnipotent.&nbsp; He would
be Michelangelesque, and that by sheer force of minuteness.&nbsp;
He exaggerated scientifically, and made things gigantic by a
microscopic fulness of detail.&nbsp; His Hulot was to remain the
Antony of modern romance, losing the world for the love of woman,
and content to lose it; his Marneffe, in whom is incarnated the
instinct and the science of sexual corruption, is Hulot&rsquo;s
Cleopatra, and only dies because &lsquo;elle va faire le bon
Dieu&rsquo;&mdash;as who should say &lsquo;to mash the Old
Man&rsquo;; Frenh&oelig;ffer, Philippe Bridau, Vautrin, Marsay,
Rastignac, Grandet, Balthazar Cla&euml;s, B&eacute;atrix,
Sarrazine, Lousteau, Esther, Lucien Chardon&mdash;the list is, I
believe, some thousands strong!&nbsp; Also the argument is proved
in advance: there is the <i>Com&eacute;die</i>
itself&mdash;&lsquo;the new edition fifty volumes
long.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bad or good, foul or fair, impossible or
actual, a monstrous debauch of mind or a triumph of realisation,
there is the <i>Com&eacute;die</i>.&nbsp; It is forty years since
Balzac squared and laid the last stones of it; and it
exists&mdash;if a little the worse for wear: the bulk is
enormous&mdash;if the materials be in some sort worm-eaten <!--
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>and crumbling.&nbsp; Truly, he had &lsquo;incomparable
power.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was the least capable and the most
self-conscious of artists; his observation was that of an
inspired and very careful auctioneer; he was a visionary and a
fanatic; he was gross, ignorant, morbid of mind, cruel in heart,
vexed with a strain of Sadism that makes him on the whole
corrupting and ignoble in effect.&nbsp; But he divined and
invented prodigiously if he observed and recorded tediously, and
his achievement remains a phantasmagoria of desperate suggestions
and strange, affecting situations and potent and inordinate
effects.&nbsp; He may be impossible; but there is French
literature and French society to show that he passed that way,
and had &lsquo;incomparable power.&rsquo;&nbsp; The phrase is Mr.
Henry James&rsquo;s, and it is hard to talk of Balzac and refrain
from it.</p>

<h3>Teniers or Daumier?</h3>
<p>To the maker of Poirier and Fabrice, of S&eacute;raphine and
Giboyer, of Olympe and the Marquis d&rsquo;Auberive, there were
analogies between the genius of Labiche and the genius of
Teniers.&nbsp; &lsquo;C&rsquo;est au premier abord,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;le m&ecirc;me aspect de caricature; c&rsquo;est, en y
regardant de plus pr&egrave;s, la m&ecirc;me finesse de tons, la
m&ecirc;me justesse d&rsquo;expression, la m&ecirc;me
vivacit&eacute; de mouvement.&rsquo;&nbsp; For myself, I like to
think of Labiche as in some sort akin to Honor&eacute;
Daumier.&nbsp; Earnestness and accomplishment apart, he has much
in common with that king of caricaturists.&nbsp; The lusty
frankness, the jovial ingenuity, the keen sense of the
ridiculous, the insatiable instinct of observation, of the
draughtsman are a great part of the equipment of the
playwright.&nbsp; Augier notes that truth is everywhere in
Labiche&rsquo;s work, and Augier is right.&nbsp; He is before
everything a dramatist: an artist, that is, whose function is to
tell a story in action and by the mouths of its personages; and
whimsical and absurd as he loves to be, he is never either the
one or the other at the expense of nature.&nbsp; He is often
careless and futile: he will squander&mdash;(as in <i>Vingt-neuf
Degr&eacute;s &agrave; l&rsquo;Ombre</i> and <i>l&rsquo;Avare en
Gants</i> <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span><i>Jaunes</i>)&mdash;an idea that
rightly belongs to the domain of pure comedy on the presentation
of a most uproarious farce.&nbsp; But he is never any falser to
his vocation than this.&nbsp; Now and then, as in <i>Moi</i> and
<i>le Voyage de M. Perrichon</i>, he is an excellent comic poet,
dealing with comedy seriously as comedy should be dealt with, and
incarnating a vice or an affectation in a certain character with
impeccable justness and assurance.&nbsp; Now and then, as in
<i>les Petits Oiseaux</i> and <i>les Vivacit&eacute;s du
Capitaine Tic</i>, he is content to tell a charming story as
pleasantly as possible.&nbsp; Sometimes, as in <i>C&eacute;limare
le Bien-Aim&eacute;</i> (held by M. Sarcey to be the high-water
mark of the modern <i>vaudeville</i>), <i>le Plus Heureux des
Trois</i>, and <i>le Prix Martin</i>, he fights again from a
humouristic point of view that triangular duel between the wife,
the husband, and the lover which fills so large a place in the
literature of France; and then he shows the reverse of the medal
of adultery&mdash;with the husband at his ease, the seducer
haunted by the ghosts of old sins, the erring wife the slave of
her unsuspecting lord.&nbsp; Or again, he takes to turning the
world upside down, and&mdash;as in the <i>Cagnotte</i>, the
<i>Chapeau de Paille</i>, and the <i>Trente Millions</i>&mdash;to
producing a scheme of morals and society that seems to have been
dictated from an Olympus demoralised by champagne and
lobster.&nbsp; But at his wildest he never forgets that men and
women are themselves.&nbsp; His dialogue is always right and
appropriate, however extravagant it be.&nbsp; <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>His vivid
and varied knowledge of life and character supplies him with
touches enough of nature and truth to make the fortune of a dozen
ordinary dramatists; and withal you feel as you read that he is
writing, as Augier says of him, to amuse himself merely, and that
he could an if he would be solemn and didactic with all the
impressiveness that a perfect acquaintance with men and things
and an admirable dramatic aptitude can bestow.&nbsp; The fact
that he is always in a good temper has done him some wrong in
that it has led him to be to all appearances amusing only, where
he might well have posed as a severe and serious artist.&nbsp;
But he is none the less true for having elected to be funny, and
there is certainly more genuine human nature and human feeling in
such drolleries as the <i>Chapeau de Paille</i> and <i>le Plus
Heureux des Trois</i> than in all the serious dramas of Ponsard
(say) and Hugo put together.</p>
<h3>Labiche.</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most characteristic and individual part of his
work is that in which he has given his invention full swing, and
allowed his humour to play its maddest pranks at will.&nbsp;
<i>Moi</i> is an admirable comedy, and De la Porcheraie is almost
hideously egoistic; the <i>Voyage de M. Perrichon</i> is
delightful reading, <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>and Perrichon is as pompous an ass
as I know; but the <i>Chapeau de Paille</i>, the <i>Cagnotte</i>,
the <i>Trente Millions</i>, the <i>Sensitive</i>, the <i>Deux
Merles Blancs</i>, the <i>Doit-On le Dire</i>, and their
compeers&mdash;with them it is other-guess work altogether.&nbsp;
In these whimsical phantasmagorias men and women move and speak
as at the bidding of destinies drunk with laughing-gas.&nbsp;
Time and chance have gone demented, fate has turned comic poet,
society has become its own parody, everybody is the irrepressible
caricature of himself.&nbsp; You are in a topsy-turvy world,
enveloped in an atmosphere instinct with gaiety and folly, where
burlesque is natural and only the extravagant is normal; where
your Chim&aelig;ra has grown frolic, your Nightmare is first
Cousin to the Cheshire Cat, and your Sphinxes are all upon the
spree; and where you have as little concern for what is real as
you have in that hemisphere of the great globe of
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;that has Scapin and Sganarelle for its
breed-bates, and Pourceaugnac for its butt, and Pancrace and
Marphurius for its scientific men, and L&eacute;lie and
Agn&egrave;s for its incarnations of love and beauty.&nbsp; That
the creator of such a world as this should have aspired to the
Academy&rsquo;s spare arm-chair&mdash;that one above all others
but just vacated by the respectable M. de Sacy&mdash;was a fact
that roused the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> even to
satire.&nbsp; But if the arm-chair brought honour with it, then
no man better deserved the privilege than Eug&egrave;ne <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Labiche, for he had amused and kept awake the public
for nearly forty years&mdash;for almost as long, that is, as the
<i>Revue</i> had been sending it to sleep.&nbsp; There are times
and seasons when a good laugh makes more for edification than
whole folios of good counsel.&nbsp; &lsquo;I regarded him
not,&rsquo; quoth Sir John of one that would have moved him to
sapience, &lsquo;and yet he talked wisely.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Sir
John, whatever his opinion of the <i>Revue</i>, would never have
said all that&mdash;the second part of it he might&mdash;of
anything signed &lsquo;Eug&egrave;ne Labiche,&rsquo; nor&mdash;so
I love to believe&mdash;would his august creator either.&nbsp;
For is not his work so full of quick, fiery, and delectable
shapes as to be perpetual sherris?&nbsp; And when time and season
fit, what more can the heart of man desire?</p>
<h2><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>CHAMPFLEURY</h2>
<h3>The Man.</h3>
<p>Champfleury&mdash;novelist, dramatist, arch&aelig;ologist,
humourist, and literary historian&mdash;belonged to a later
generation than that of Petrus Borel and Philoth&eacute;e
O&rsquo;Neddy; but he could remember the production of <i>les
Burgraves</i>, and was able of his own personal knowledge to
laugh at the melancholy speech of poor C&eacute;lestin
Nanteuil&mdash;the famous &lsquo;Il n&rsquo;y a plus de
jeunesse&rsquo; of a man grown old and incredulous and apathetic
before his time: the lament over a yesterday already a hundred
years behind.&nbsp; He had lived in the Latin quarter; he had
dined with Flicoteaux, and listened to the orchestras of Habeneck
and Musard; he had heard the chimes at midnight with Baudelaire
and Murger, hissed the tragedies of Ponsard, applauded Deburau
and Rouvi&egrave;re, and seen the rise and fall of Courbet and
Dupont.&nbsp; If he was not of the giants he was of their
immediate successors, and he had seen them actually at
work.&nbsp; He had hacked for Balzac, and read romantic prose at
Victor Hugo&rsquo;s; he had lived so near the red waistcoat of
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier as to dare to go up and down in Paris
(under <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the inspiration of the artist of
<i>la Femme qui taille la Soupe</i>) in &lsquo;un habit en
bouracan vert avec col &agrave; la Marat, un gilet de couleur
bachique, et une culotte en drap d&rsquo;un jaune assez
mals&eacute;ant,&rsquo; together with &lsquo;une triomphante
cravate de soie jaune&rsquo;&mdash;a vice of Baudelaire&rsquo;s
inventing&mdash;and &lsquo;un feutre ras dans le go&ucirc;t de la
coiffure de Camille Desmoulins.&rsquo;&nbsp; And having seen for
himself, he could judge for himself as well.&nbsp; From first to
last he showed himself to be out of sympathy with the ambitions
and effects of romanticism.&nbsp; He was born a humourist and an
observer, and he became a &lsquo;realist&rsquo; as soon as he
began to write.</p>
<h3>The Writer.</h3>
<p>His work is an antipodes not only of <i>Hernani</i> and
<i>Notre-Dame</i> but of <i>Sarrazine</i> and <i>la Cousine
Bette</i> and <i>B&eacute;atrix</i> as well.&nbsp; For the
commonplace types and incidents, the everyday passions and
fortunes, of the <i>Aventures de Mariette</i> and the
<i>Mascarade de la Vie Parisienne</i> represent a reaction not
alone against the sublimities and the extravagance of Hugo but
against the heroic aggrandisement of things trivial of Balzac as
well.&nbsp; True, they deal with kindred subjects, and they
purport to be a record of life as it is and not of life as it
<!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>ought to be.&nbsp; But the pupil&rsquo;s point of view
is poles apart from the master&rsquo;s; his intention, his
ambition, his inspiration, belong to another order of
ideas.&nbsp; He contents himself with observing and noting and
reflecting; with making prose prosaic and adding sobriety and
plainness to a plain and sober story; with being merely curious
and intelligent; with using experience not as an intoxicant but
as a staple of diet; with considering fact not as the raw
material of inspiration but as inspiration itself.&nbsp; Between
an artist of this sort&mdash;pedestrian, good-tempered, touched
with malice, a little cynical&mdash;and the noble desperadoes of
1830 there could be little sympathy; and there seems no reason
why the one should be the others&rsquo; historian, and none why,
if their historian he should be, his history should be other than
partial and narrow&mdash;than at best an achievement in special
pleading.&nbsp; But Champfleury&rsquo;s was a personality
apart.&nbsp; His master quality was curiosity; he was interested
in everything, and he was above all things interested in men and
women; he had a liberal mind and no prejudices; he had the
scientific spirit and the scientific intelligence, if he
sometimes spoke with the voice of the humourist and in the terms
of the artist in words; and his studies in romanticism are far
better literature than his experiments in fiction.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 151</span>LONGFELLOW</h2>
<h3>Sea Poets.</h3>
<p>The ocean as confidant, a Laertes that can neither avoid his
Hamlets nor bid them hold their peace, is a modern
invention.&nbsp; Byron and Shelley discovered it; Heine took it
into his confidence, and told it the story of his loves;
Wordsworth made it a moral influence; Browning loved it in his
way, but his way was not often the poet&rsquo;s; to Matthew
Arnold it was the voice of destiny, and its message was a message
of despair; Hugo conferred with it as with an humble friend, and
uttered such lofty things over it as are rarely heard upon the
lips of man.&nbsp; And so with living lyrists each after his
kind.&nbsp; Lord Tennyson listens and looks until it strikes him
out an undying note of passion, or yearning, or regret&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Sunset and evening
star,<br />
And one clear call for me&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Swinburne maddens with the wind and the sounds and the
scents of it, until there passes into his verse a something of
its vastness and its vehemency, the rapture of its inspiration,
the palpitating, many-twinkling miracle of its light; Mr. William
Morris has been taken with the manner of its melancholy; while to
Whitman it <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>has been &lsquo;the great
Camerado&rsquo; indeed, for it gave him that song of the brown
bird bereft of his mate in whose absence the half of him had not
been told to us.</p>
<h3>Longfellow.</h3>
<p>But to Longfellow alone was it given to see that stately
galley which Count Arnaldos saw; his only to hear the steersman
singing that wild and wondrous song which none that hears it can
resist, and none that has heard it may forget.&nbsp; Then did he
learn the old monster&rsquo;s secret&mdash;the word of his charm,
the core of his mystery, the human note in his music, the quality
of his influence upon the heart and the mind of man; and then did
he win himself a place apart among sea poets.&nbsp; With the most
of them it is a case of <i>Ego et rex meus</i>: It is I and the
sea, and my egoism is as valiant and as vocal as the
other&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But Longfellow is the spokesman of a
confraternity; what thrills him to utterance is the spirit of
that strange and beautiful freemasonry established as long ago as
when the first sailor steered the first keel out into the
unknown, irresistible water-world, and so established the
foundations of the eternal brotherhood of man with ocean.&nbsp;
To him the sea is a place of mariners and ships.&nbsp; In his
verse the rigging creaks, the white sail fills and crackles,
there are blown smells <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of pine and
hemp and tar; you catch the home wind on your cheeks; and old
shipmen, their eyeballs white in their bronzed faces, with silver
rings and gaudy handkerchiefs, come in and tell you moving
stories of the immemorial, incommunicable deep.&nbsp; He abides
in a port; he goes down to the docks, and loiters among the
galiots and brigantines, he hears the melancholy song of the
chanty-men; he sees the chips flying under the shipwright&rsquo;s
adze; he smells the pitch that smokes and bubbles in the
caldron.&nbsp; And straightway he falls to singing his variations
on the ballad of Count Arnaldos; and the world listens, for its
heart beats in his song.</p>

<h3>St. Agnes&rsquo; Eve.</h3>
<p>In Keats&rsquo;s <i>St. Agnes&rsquo; Eve</i> nothing is white
but the heroine.&nbsp; It is winter, and &lsquo;bitter
chill&rsquo;; the hare &lsquo;limps trembling through the frozen
grass; the owl is a-cold for all his feathers; the
beadsman&rsquo;s fingers are numb, his breath is frosted; and at
an instant of special and peculiar romance</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The
frost-wind blows<br />
Like Love&rsquo;s alarum, pattering the sharp sleet<br />
Against the window-panes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is no snow.&nbsp; The picture is pure colour: it
blushes with blood of queens and kings; it glows with
&lsquo;splendid dyes,&rsquo; like the &lsquo;tiger-moth&rsquo;s
deep-damasked wings&rsquo;&mdash;with &lsquo;rose bloom,&rsquo;
and warm gules,&rsquo; and &lsquo;soft amethyst&rsquo;; it is
loud with music and luxurious with &lsquo;spiced dainties,&rsquo;
with lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon,&rsquo; with &lsquo;manna
and dates,&rsquo; the fruitage of Fez and &lsquo;cedared
Lebanon&rsquo; and &lsquo;silken Samarcand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, the
Laureate&rsquo;s <i>St. Agnes&rsquo; Eve</i> is an ecstasy of
colourless perfection.&nbsp; The snows sparkle on the convent
roof; the &lsquo;first snowdrop&rsquo; vies with St. Agnes&rsquo;
virgin bosom; the moon shines an &lsquo;argent round&rsquo; in
the &lsquo;frosty skies&rsquo;; and in a transport of purity the
lady prays:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>&lsquo;Break up thy heavens, O Lord!
and far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all the starlight keen,<br />
Draw me thy bride, a glittering star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In raiment white and clean.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is all coldly, miraculously stainless: as somebody has
said, &lsquo;la vraie <i>Symphonie en Blanc
Majeur</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Indian Summer.</h3>
<p>And at four-score the poet of <i>St. Agnes&rsquo; Eve</i> is
still our greatest since the Wordsworth of certain sonnets and
the two immortal odes: is still the one Englishman of whom it can
be stated and believed that Elisha is not less than Elijah.&nbsp;
His verse is far less smooth and less lustrous than in the
well-filed times of <i>In Memoriam</i> and the Arthurian
idylls.&nbsp; But it is also far more plangent and affecting; it
shows a larger and more liberal mastery of form and therewith a
finer, stronger, saner sentiment of material; in its display of
breadth and freedom in union with particularity, of
suggestiveness with precision, of swiftness of handling with
completeness of effect, it reminds you of the later magic of
Rembrandt and the looser and richer, the less artful-seeming but
more ample and sumptuous, of the styles of Shakespeare.&nbsp; And
the matter is worthy of the manner.&nbsp; Everywhere are
greatness and a high imagination moving at ease in the gold <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>armour of an heroic style.&nbsp; There are passages in
<i>Demeter and Persephone</i> that will vie with the best in
<i>Lucretius</i>; <i>Miriam</i> is worth a wilderness of
<i>Aylmer&rsquo;s Fields</i>; <i>Owd Ro&auml;</i> is one of the
best of the studies in dialect; in <i>Happy</i> there are stanzas
that recall the passion of <i>Rizpah</i>; nothing in modern
English so thrills and vibrates with the prophetic inspiration,
the fury of the seer, as <i>Vastness</i>; the verses <i>To Mary
Boyle</i>&mdash;(in the same stanza as Musset&rsquo;s <i>le Mie
Prigioni</i>)&mdash;are marked by such a natural grace of form
and such a winning &lsquo;affectionateness,&rsquo; to coin a
word, of intention and accomplishment as Lord Tennyson has never
surpassed nor very often equalled.&nbsp; In <i>Vastness</i> the
insight into essentials, the command of primordial matter, the
capacity of vital suggestion, are gloriously in evidence from the
first line to the last.&nbsp; Here is no touch of ingenuity, no
trace of &lsquo;originality,&rsquo; no single sign of cleverness;
the rhymes are merely inevitable&mdash;there is no visible
transformation of metaphor in deference to their suggestions;
nothing is antic, peculiar, superfluous; but here in epic unity
and completeness, here is a sublimation of experience expressed
by means of a sublimation of style.&nbsp; It is unique in
English, and for all that one can see it is like to remain unique
this good while yet.&nbsp; The impression you take is one of
singular loftiness of purpose and a rare nobility of mind.&nbsp;
Looking upon life and time and the spirit of man from the <!--
page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>heights of his eighty years, it has been given to the
Master Poet to behold much that is hid to them in the plain or on
the slopes beneath him, and beholding it to frame and utter a
message so lofty in style and in significance so potent that it
sounds as of this world indeed but from the confines of
experience, the farthest kingdoms of mortality.</p>
<h3>His Mastership.</h3>
<p>It is to note, too, that the Laureate of to-day deals with
language in a way that to the Tennyson of the beginning
was&mdash;unhappily&mdash;impossible.&nbsp; In those early years
he neither would nor could have been responsible for the
magnificent and convincing rhythms of <i>Vastness</i>, the
austere yet passionate shapeliness of <i>Happy</i>, the effects
of vigour and variety realised in <i>Parnassus</i>.&nbsp; For in
those early years he was rather Benvenuto than Michelangelo, he
was more of a jeweller than a sculptor, the phrase was too much
to him, the inspiration of the incorrect too little.&nbsp; All
that is changed, and for the best.&nbsp; Most interesting is it
to the artist to remark how impatient&mdash;(as the Milton of the
<i>Agonistes</i> was)&mdash;of rhyme and how confident in rhythm
is the whilome poet of <i>Oriana</i> and <i>The Lotus-Eaters</i>
and <i>The Vision of Sin</i>; and how this impatience and this
confidence are revealed not merely in a piece of mysticism naked
yet unashamed as <i>The Gleam</i>&mdash;(whose movement <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>with its constancy in double endings and avoidance of
triplets is perhaps a little tame)&mdash;but also in what should
have been a popular piece: the ode, to wit, <i>On the Jubilee of
Queen Victoria</i>.&nbsp; In eld, indeed, the craftsman inclines
to play with his material: he is conscious of mastery; he is in
the full enjoyment of his own; he indulges in experiments which
to him are as a crown of glory and to them that come after
him&mdash;to the noodles that would walk in his ways without
first preparing themselves by prayer and study and a life of
abnegation&mdash;are only the devil in disguise.&nbsp; The
Rembrandt of <i>The Syndics</i>, the Shakespeare of <i>The
Tempest</i> and <i>Lear</i>&mdash;what are these but pits for the
feet of the Young Ass? and what else will be the Tennyson of
<i>Vastness</i> and <i>The Gleam</i>?&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo;
quoth Dickens years ago in respect of the <i>Idylls</i> or of
<i>Maud</i>, &lsquo;what a pleasure it is to come across a man
that can <i>write</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; He also was an artist in
words; and what he said then he would say now with greater
emphasis and more assurance.&nbsp; From the first Lord Tennyson
has been an exemplar; and now in these new utterances, his
supremacy is completely revealed.&nbsp; There is no fear now that
&lsquo;All will grow the flower, For all have got the
seed&rsquo;; for then it was a mannerism that people took and
imitated, and now&mdash;!&nbsp; Now it is art; it is the greater
Shakespeare, the consummate Rembrandt, the unique Velasquez; and
they may rise to it that can.</p>
<h2><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>GORDON HAKE</h2>
<h3>Aim and Equipment.</h3>
<p>Dr. Hake is one of the most earnest and original of
poets.&nbsp; He has taken nothing from his contemporaries, but
has imagined a message for himself, and has chosen to deliver it
in terms that are wholly his own.&nbsp; For him the accidents and
trivialities of individualism, the transitory and changing facts
that make up the external aspect of an age or a character, can
hardly be said to exist.&nbsp; He only concerns himself with
absolutes&mdash;the eternal elements of human life and the
immutable tides of human destiny.&nbsp; It is of these that the
stuff of his message is compacted; it is from these that its
essence is distilled.&nbsp; His talk is not of Arthur and
Guinevere, nor Chastelard and Atalanta, nor Paracelsus and Luria
and Abt Vogler; of &lsquo;the drawing-room and the deanery&rsquo;
he has nothing to say; nothing of the tendencies of Strauss and
Renan, nothing of the New Renaissance, nothing of Botticelli, nor
the ballet, nor the text of Shakespeare, nor the joys of the
book-hunter, nor the quaintness of Queen Anne, nor the morals of
Helen of Troy.&nbsp; To these he prefers the mystery of death,
the significance of life, the quality of <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>human and
divine love; the hopes and fears and the joys and sorrows that
are the perdurable stuff of existence, the inexhaustible and
unchanging principles of activity in man.&nbsp; Now it is only to
the few that reduced to their simplest expression the
&lsquo;eternal verities&rsquo; are engaging and impressive.&nbsp;
To touch the many they must be conveyed in human terms; they must
be presented not as impersonal abstractions, not as matter for
the higher intelligence and the higher emotions, but as living,
breathing, individual facts, vivid with the circumstance of
terrene life, quick with the thoughts and ambitions of the hour,
full charged with familiar and neighbourly associations.&nbsp;
All this with Dr. Hake is by no means inevitable.&nbsp; He loves
to symbolise; he does not always care that the symbol shall be
appropriate and plain.&nbsp; He prefers to work in allegory and
emblem; but he does not always see that, however representative
to himself, his emblems and his allegories may not be altogether
representative to the world.&nbsp; His imagination is at once
quaint and far-reaching&mdash;at once peculiar and ambitious; and
it is often guilty of what is recondite and remote.&nbsp; In his
best work&mdash;in <i>Old Souls</i>, for instance, and <i>Old
Morality</i>&mdash;the quaintness is merely decorative: the
essentials are sound and human enough to be of lasting interest
and to have a capacity of common application.&nbsp; Elsewhere his
imagery is apt to become strange and unaffecting, his fancy to
work in curious and desolate <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>ways, his
message to sound abstruse and strange; and these effects too are
deepened by the qualities and the merits of his style.&nbsp; It
is peculiarly his own, but it is not always felicitous.&nbsp;
There are times when it has the true epic touch&mdash;or at least
as much of it as is possible in an age of detail and elaboration;
there are times when it has a touch of the pathetic&mdash;when in
homeliness of phrase and triviality of rhythm it is hardly to be
surpassed; and there are times, as in <i>The Snake Charmer</i>
when, as in certain pages in the work of Richard Wagner, it is so
studiously laboured and so heavily charged with ornament and
colour as to be almost pedantic in infelicity, almost repellent
by sheer force of superfluous and elaborate suggestiveness.&nbsp;
Last of all, in an epoch trained upon the passionate and subtle
cadences of the Laureate and the large-moulded, ample,
irresistible melodies of Mr. Swinburne, Dr. Hake chooses to deal
in rhythms of the utmost na&iuml;vet&eacute; and in metrical
forms that are simplicity itself.</p>
<h2><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span

<h3>Anti-Landor.</h3>
<p>To the many, Landor has always been more or less
unapproachable, and has always seemed more or less shadowy and
unreal.&nbsp; To begin with, he wrote for himself and a few
others, and principally for himself.&nbsp; Then, he wrote
waywardly and unequally as well as selfishly; he published pretty
much at random; the bulk of his work is large; and the majority
has passed him by for writers more accessible and work less
freakish and more comprehensible.&nbsp; It is probable too that
even among those who, inspired by natural temerity or the
intemperate curiosity of the general reader, have essayed his
conquest and set out upon what has been described as &lsquo;the
Adventure of the Seven Volumes which are Seven Valleys of Dry
Bones,&rsquo; but few have returned victorious.&nbsp; Of course
the Seven Volumes are a world.&nbsp; But (it is objected) the
world is peculiar in pattern, abounding in antres vast and
desarts idle, in gaps and precipices and &lsquo;manifest
solutions of continuity,&rsquo; and enveloped in an atmosphere
which ordinary lungs <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>find now too rare and now too dense
and too anodyne.&nbsp; Moreover, it is peopled chiefly with
abstractions: bearing noble and suggestive names but all
surprisingly alike in stature and feature, all more or less
incapable of sustained emotion and even of logical argument, all
inordinately addicted to superb generalities and a kind of
monumental skittishness, all expressing themselves in a style
whose principal characteristic is a magnificent monotony, and all
apparently the outcome of a theory that to be wayward is to be
creative, that human interest is a matter of apophthegms and
oracular sentences, and that axiomatic and dramatic are identical
qualities and convertible terms.&nbsp; This is the opinion of
those adventurers in whom defeat has generated a sense of injury
and an instinct of antagonism.&nbsp; Others less fortunate still
have found Landor a continent of dulness and futility&mdash;have
come to consider the Seven Volumes as so many aggregations of
tedium.&nbsp; Such experiences are one-sided and partial no
doubt; and considered from a certain point of view they seem
worthless enough.&nbsp; But they exist, and they are in some sort
justified.&nbsp; Landor, when all is said, remains a
writers&rsquo; writer; and for my part I find it impossible not
to feel a certain sympathy with them that hesitate to accept him
for anything else.</p>
<h3>His Drama.</h3>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Again, to some of us Lander&rsquo;s imagination is not
only inferior in kind but poverty-stricken in degree; his
creative faculty is limited by the reflection that its one
achievement is Landor; his claim to consideration as a dramatic
writer is negatived by the fact that, poignant as are the
situations with which he loved to deal, he was apparently
incapable of perceiving their capacities: inasmuch as he has
failed completely and logically to develop a single one of them;
inasmuch, too, as he has never once succeeded in conceiving, much
less in picturing, such a train of conflicting emotions as any
one of the complications from which he starts might be supposed
to generate.&nbsp; To many there is nothing Greek about his
dramatic work except the absence of stage directions; and to
these that quality of &lsquo;Landorian abruptness&rsquo; which
seems to Mr. Sidney Colvin to excuse so many of its shortcomings
is identical with a certain sort of what in men of lesser mould
is called stupidity.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 165</span>HOOD</h2>
<h3>How Much of Him?</h3>
<p>Hood wrote much for bread, and he wrote much under pressure of
all manner of difficulties&mdash;want of health and want of
money, the hardship of exile and the bitterness of comparative
failure; and not a little of what he produced is the merest
journalism, here to-day and gone to-morrow.&nbsp; At his highest
he is very high, but it was not given to him to enjoy the
conditions under which great work is produced: he had neither
peace of body nor health of mind, his life from first to last was
a struggle with sickness and misfortune.&nbsp; How is it possible
to maintain an interest in all he wrote, when two-thirds of it
was produced with duns at the door and a nurse in the other room
and the printer&rsquo;s-devil waiting in the hall?&nbsp; Of his
admirable courage, his fine temper, his unfailing goodness of
heart, his incorruptible honesty, it were hard to speak too
highly; for one has but to read the story of his life to wonder
that he should have written anything at all.&nbsp; At his
happiest he had the gift of laughter; at his deepest and truest
the more precious gift of tears.&nbsp; But for him there were
innumerable hours when the best he could <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>affect was
the hireling&rsquo;s motley; when his fun and his pathos alike
ran strained and thin; when the unique poet and wit became a mere
comic rhymester.&nbsp; Is it just to his memory that it should be
burdened with such a mass of what is already antiquated?&nbsp;
But one answer is possible.&nbsp; The immortal part of Hood might
be expressed into a single tiny volume.</p>
<h3>Death&rsquo;s Jest-Book.</h3>
<p>Thackeray preferred Hood&rsquo;s passion to his fun; and
Thackeray knew.&nbsp; Hood had an abundance of a certain sort of
wit, the wit of odd analogies, of remote yet familiar
resemblances, of quaint conceits and humourous and unexpected
quirks.&nbsp; He made not epigrams but jokes, sometimes purely
intellectual but nearly always with the verbal quality as
well.&nbsp; The wonderful jingle called <i>Miss
Kilmansegg</i>&mdash;hard and cold and glittering as the gold
that gleams in it&mdash;abounds in capital types of both.&nbsp;
But for an example of both here is a stanza taken at random from
the <i>Ode to the Great Unknown</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thou <i>Scottish Barmecide</i>, feeding the
hunger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of curiosity with airy gammon;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou mystery-monger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dealing it out like middle cut of salmon</i><br
/>
<i>That people buy and can&rsquo;t make head or tail of
it</i>,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth, and so forth: the first a specimen <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>of
oddness of analogy&mdash;the joke intellectual; the second a jest
in which the intellectual quality is complicated with the
verbal.&nbsp; Of rarer merit are that conceit of the door which
was shut with such a slam &lsquo;it sounded like a wooden
d---n,&rsquo; and that mad description of the demented
mariner,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;His head was <i>turned</i>, and so he
<i>chewed</i><br />
<i>His pigtail</i> till he died,&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is a pun as unexpected and imaginative as any that
exists, not excepting even Lamb&rsquo;s renowned achievement, the
immortal &lsquo;I say, Porter, is that your own Hare or a
Wig?&rsquo;&nbsp; But as a punster Hood is merely
unsurpassable.&nbsp; The simplest and the most complex, the
wildest and the most obvious, the straightest and the most
perverse, all puns came alike to him.&nbsp; The form was his
natural method of expression.&nbsp; His prose
extravaganzas&mdash;even to the delightful <i>Friend in
Need</i>&mdash;are pretty well forgotten; his one novel is very
hard to read; there is far less in <i>Up the Rhine</i> than in
<i>Humphry Clinker</i> after all; we have been spoiled for
<i>Lycus the Centaur</i> and <i>The Plea of the Midsummer
Fairies</i> by the rich and passionate verse of the Laureate, the
distinction, and the measure of Arnold, the sumptuous diction and
the varied and enchanting music of <i>Atalanta</i> and
<i>Hesperia</i> and <i>Erechtheus</i>.&nbsp; We care little for
the old-fashioned whimsicality of the <i>Odes</i>, and little for
such an inimitable farrago of vulgarisms, such a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of sentiment and style, as <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span><i>The Lost
Child</i>.&nbsp; But the best of Hood&rsquo;s puns are amusing
after forty years.&nbsp; They are the classics of verbal
extravagance, and they are a thousand times better known than
<i>The Last Man</i>, though that is a work of genius, and almost
as popular as the <i>Song of the Shirt</i>, the <i>Bridge of
Sighs</i>, the <i>Dream of Eugene Aram</i> themselves.&nbsp; By
an odd chance, too, the rhymes in which they are set have all a
tragic theme.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tout ce qui touche &agrave; la
mort,&rsquo; says Champfleury, &lsquo;est d&rsquo;une
gaiet&eacute; folle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hood found out that much for
himself before Champfleury had begun to write.&nbsp; His most
riotous ballads are ballads of death and the grave.&nbsp; Tim
Turpin does murder and is hanged</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On Horsham drop, and none can say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a drop too much&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben Battle entwines a rope about his melancholy neck, and for
the second time in life <i>enlists him in the line</i>; Young Ben
expires of grief for the falsehood of Sally Brown: Lieutenant
Luff drinks himself into his grave; John Day the amorous
coachman,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With back too broad to be conceived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By any narrow mind,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>pines to nothingness, and is found heels uppermost in his
cruel mistress&rsquo;s water-butt.&nbsp; To Hood, with his grim
imagination and his strange fantastic humour, death was meat and
drink.&nbsp; It is as though he saw so much of the
&lsquo;execrable Shape&rsquo; <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>that at
last the pair grew friends, and grinned whenever they
foregathered even in thought.</p>
<h3>His Immortal Part.</h3>
<p>Was Thackeray right, then, in resenting the waste of
Hood&rsquo;s genius upon mere comicalities?&nbsp; I think he was;
but only to a certain point.&nbsp; Hood was a true poet: but it
was not until after years of proof and endeavour that he
discovered the use to which his powers could best be put and the
material on which they could best be employed.&nbsp; He worked
hard and with but partial success at poetry all his life
long.&nbsp; He passed his life in punning and making comic
assaults on the Queen&rsquo;s English; but he was author all the
while of <i>The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies</i>, the <i>Ode to
Melancholy</i>, <i>Hero and Leander</i>, <i>Lycus the
Centaur</i>, and a score and more of lovable and moving ballads;
and he had won himself a name with two such capital examples of
melodrama as <i>The Last Man</i> (1826) and <i>The Dream of
Eugene Aram</i> (1829).&nbsp; But as a poet he profited
little.&nbsp; The public preferred him as a buffoon; and not
until his last years (and then anonymously) was he able to utter
his highest word.&nbsp; All was made ready against his
coming&mdash;the age, the subject, the public mind, the public
capacity of emotion; and in <i>The Song of the Shirt</i> he
approved himself a great <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>singer.&nbsp; In the days of <i>Lycus the Centaur</i>
and the <i>Midsummer Fairies</i> he could no more have written it
than the public could have heeded had he written.&nbsp; But times
were changed&mdash;Dickens had come, and the humanitarian
epoch&mdash;and the great song went like fire.&nbsp; So, a year
or two after, did <i>The Bridge of Sighs</i>.&nbsp; That, says
Thackeray, &lsquo;was his Corunna, his Heights of
Abraham&mdash;sickly, weak, wounded, he fell in the full blaze
and fame of that great victory.&rsquo;&nbsp; Could he have
repeated it had he lived?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; In both these
irresistible appeals to the heart of man the material is of equal
value and importance with the form; and in poetry such material
is rare.&nbsp; A brace of such songs is possible to a poet; ten
couples are not.&nbsp; It is Hood&rsquo;s immortality that he
sang these two.&nbsp; Almost in the uttering they went the round
of the world; and it is not too much to say of them that they
will only pass with the language.</p>
<h2><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>LEVER</h2>
<h3>How He Lived.</h3>
<p>The story of Lever&rsquo;s life and adventures only wants
telling to be as irresistibly attractive as Lorrequer&rsquo;s or
O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; Born in Dublin, of an English
father and an Irish mother, he lived to be essentially
cosmopolitan and a <i>viveur</i> of the first magnitude.&nbsp; At
eight he was master of his schoolmaster&mdash;a gentleman given
to flogging but not learned in Greek, and therefore a proper
subject for a certain sort of blackmailing.&nbsp; He was not an
industrious boy; but he was apt and ready with his tongue, he was
an expert in fencing and the dance, he was good at improvising
and telling stories, it is on record that he pleaded and won the
cause of himself and certain of his schoolmates accused before a
magistrate of riot and outrage.&nbsp; At college he found work
for his high spirits in wild fun and the perpetration of
practical jokes.&nbsp; He and his chum Ottiwell, the original of
Frank Webber, behaved to their governors, teachers, and
companions very much as Charles O&rsquo;Malley and the
redoubtable Frank behave to theirs.&nbsp; Lever was excellent at
a street-ballad, and made and sang them in the rags of Rhoudlim,
just <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>as Frank Webber does; and he
personated Cusack the surgeon to Cusack&rsquo;s class, just as
Frank Webber personates the dean to <i>his</i> class.&nbsp; On
the whole, indeed, he must have been as gamesome and volatile a
nuisance as even Dublin has endured.&nbsp; On leaving college he
took charge of an emigrant ship bound for Quebec.&nbsp; Arrived
in Canada, he plunged into the backwoods, was affiliated to a
tribe of Indians, and had to escape like Bagenal Daly at the risk
of his life.&nbsp; Then he went to Germany, became a student at
G&ouml;ttingen under Blumenbach, was heart and soul a Bursch, and
had the honour of seeing Goethe at Weimar.&nbsp; His diploma
gained, he went to Clare to do battle with the cholera and gather
materials for <i>Harry Lorrequer</i>.&nbsp; After this he was for
some time dispensary doctor at Portstewart, where he met
Prebendary Maxwell, the wild parson who wrote <i>Captain
Blake</i>: so that here and now it is natural to find him leaping
turf-carts and running away from his creditors.&nbsp; At
Brussels, where he physicked the British Embassy and the British
tourist, he knew all sorts of people&mdash;among them
Commissioner Meade, the original of Major Monsoon, and Cardinal
Pecci, the original of Leo <span
class="smcap">xiii.</span>&mdash;and saw all sorts of life, and
ran into all sorts of extravagance: until of a sudden, he is back
again in the capital, editing the <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; Of course he was the maddest editor <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>ever seen.&nbsp; For him cards, horses, and high living
were not luxuries but necessaries of life; yet all the while he
believed devoutly in medicine, and with his family indulged with
freedom in the use of calomel and such agents.&nbsp; Presently he
abandoned Ireland for the Continent.&nbsp; He took his horses
with him, and astonished Europe with a four-in-hand of his
own.&nbsp; Carlsruhe knew him well, as Belgium and the Rhine had
known him.&nbsp; He only left the Reider Schloss at Bregenz to
conquer Italy; and at Florence, Spezzia, and finally Trieste, he
shone like himself.</p>
<h3>What He Was.</h3>
<p>He was a born <i>poseur</i>.&nbsp; His vanity made him one of
the worst&mdash;the most excessive&mdash;of talkers; go where he
would and do what he might, he was unhappy if the first place
were another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In all he did he was greedy to excel,
and to excel incontestably.&nbsp; Like his own Bagenal Daly he
would have taken the big jump with the reins in his mouth and his
hands tied, &lsquo;just to show the English Lord-Lieutenant how
an Irish gentleman rides.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was all his life long
confounding an English Lord-Lieutenant of some sort; for without
display he would have pined away and died.&nbsp; At Templeogue
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>he lived at the rate of &pound;3,000 a year on an
income of &pound;1,200; at Brussels he kept open house on little
or nothing for all the wandering grandees of Europe; at Florence
they used to liken the cavalcade from his house to a procession
from Franconi&rsquo;s; he found living in a castle and spending
&pound;10 a day on his horses the finest fun in the world.&nbsp;
He existed but to bewilder and dazzle, and had he not been a
brilliant and distinguished novelist he would have been a
brilliant and distinguished something else.&nbsp; As he kept open
house everywhere, as he was fond of every sort of luxury, as he
loved not less to lend money to his intimates than to lose it to
them at cards, and as he got but poor prices for his novels and
was not well paid for his consular services, it is not easy to
see how he managed to make ends meet.</p>
<h3>How He Wrote.</h3>
<p>Nor is it easy to see how he contrived to produce his
novels.&nbsp; He was too passionately addicted to society and the
enjoyment of life to spare an instant from them if he could help
it; and the wonder is not that he should have written so well but
that he should have written at all.&nbsp; Fortunately or the
other thing, his books cost him no effort.&nbsp; <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>He
wrote or dictated at a gallop and, his copy once produced, had
finished his work.&nbsp; He abhorred revision, and while keenly
sensitive to blame and greedy of praise he ceased to care for his
books as soon as they had left his desk.&nbsp; That he was not in
scarce any sense an artist is but too clear.&nbsp; He never
worked on a definite plan nor was at any pains to contrive a
plot; he depended on the morning&rsquo;s impressions for the
evening&rsquo;s task, and wrote <i>Con Cregan</i> under the
immediate influence of a travelled Austrian, who used to talk to
him every night ere he sat down to his story.&nbsp; But he was a
wonderful improvisatore.&nbsp; He had imagination&mdash;(even
romantic imagination: as the episode of Menelaus Crick in <i>Con
Cregan</i> will show)&mdash;a keen, sure eye for character,
incomparable facility in composition, an inexhaustible fund of
shrewdness, whimsicality, high spirits, an admirable knack of
dialogue; and as consul at Spezzia and at Trieste, as a
fashionable practitioner at Brussels, as dispensary doctor on the
wild Ulster coast, he was excellently placed for the kind of
literature it was in him to produce.&nbsp; Writing at random and
always under the spur of necessity, he managed to inform his work
with extraordinary vitality and charm.&nbsp; His books were only
made to sell, but it is like enough that they will also live, for
they are yet well nigh as readable as at first, and Nina and Kate
O&rsquo;Donoghue&mdash;(for instance)&mdash;seem destined to go
<!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>down to posterity as typical and representative.&nbsp;
Had their author taken art seriously, and devoted all his energy
to its practice, he could scarce have done more than this.&nbsp;
Perhaps, indeed, he would not have done so much.&nbsp; It could
never have been Lorrequer&rsquo;s to &lsquo;build the lofty
rhyme.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was an honest as well as a brilliant
creature; and I believe we should all have suffered if some
avenging chance had borne it in upon him that to be really lofty
your rhyme must of necessity be not blown upwards like a bubble
but built in air like a cathedral.&nbsp; He would, I take it,
have experimentalised in repentance to the extent of elaborating
his creations and chastising his style; and, it may be, he would
have contrived but to beggar his work of interest and correct
himself of charm.&nbsp; A respectable ambition, no doubt; but how
much better to be the rough-and-ready artist of Darby the Beast
and Micky Free, the humane and charming rattlepate to whom we owe
Paul Goslett and the excellent and pleasing Potts!</p>
<h2><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>JEFFERIES</h2>
<h3>His Virtue.</h3>
<p>I love to think of Jefferies as a kind of literary
Leatherstocking.&nbsp; His style, his mental qualities, the field
he worked in, the chase he followed, were peculiar to himself,
and as he was without a rival, so was he without a second.&nbsp;
Reduced to its simplest expression, his was a mind compact of
observation and of memory.&nbsp; He writes as one who watches
always, who sees everything, who forgets nothing.&nbsp; As his
lot was cast in country places, among wood and pasturage and
corn, by coverts teeming with game and quick with insect life,
and as withal he had the hunter&rsquo;s patience and
quick-sightedness, his faculty of looking and listening and of
noting and remembering, his readiness of deduction and insistence
of pursuit&mdash;there entered gradually into his mind a greater
quantity of natural England, her leaves and flowers, her winds
and skies, her wild things and tame, her beauties and humours and
discomforts, than was ever, perhaps, the possession of writing
Briton.&nbsp; This property he conveyed to his countrymen in a
series of books of singular freshness and interest.&nbsp; The
style is too formal and sober, the English seldom other than
homely and <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>sufficient; there is overmuch of the
reporter and nothing like enough of the artist, the note of
imagination, the right creative faculty.&nbsp; But they are
remarkable books.&nbsp; It is not safe to try and be beforehand
with posterity, but in the case of such works as the
<i>Gamekeeper</i> and <i>Wild Life</i> and with such a precedent
as that established by the <i>Natural History of Selborne</i>
such anticipation seems more tempting and less hazardous than
usual.&nbsp; One has only to think of some medi&aelig;val
Jefferies attached to the staff of Robin Hood, and writing about
Needwood and Charnwood as his descendant wrote about the South
Downs, to imagine an historical document of priceless value and
inexhaustible interest.&nbsp; And in years to be, when the whole
island is one vast congeries of streets, and the fox has gone
down to the bustard and the dodo, and outside museums of
comparative anatomy the weasel is not and the badger has ceased
from the face of the earth, it is not doubtful that the
<i>Gamekeeper</i> and <i>Wild Life</i> and the
<i>Poacher</i>&mdash;epitomising, as they will, the rural England
of certain centuries before&mdash;will be serving as material and
authority for historical descriptions, historical novels,
historical epics, historical pictures, and will be honoured as
the most useful stuff of their kind in being.</p>
<h3><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>His Limitation.</h3>
<p>In those first books of his Jefferies compels attention by
sheer freshness of matter; he is brimful of new facts and
original and pertinent observation, and that every one is vaguely
familiar with and interested in the objects he is handling and
explaining serves but to heighten his attractiveness.&nbsp; There
are so many who but know of hares disguised as soup, of ants as a
people on whose houses it is not good to sit down, of partridges
as a motive of bread sauce!&nbsp; And Jefferies, retailing in
plain, useful English the thousand and one curious facts that
make up life for these creatures and their kind&mdash;Jefferies
walking the wood, or tracking the brook, or mapping out the big
tree&mdash;is some one to be heeded with gratitude.&nbsp; He is
the Scandalous Chronicler of the warren and the rookery, the
newsmonger and intelligencer of creeping things, and things that
fly, and things that run; and his confidences, unique in quality
and type, have the novelty and force of personal
revelations.&nbsp; In dealing with men and women, he surrendered
most of his advantage and lost the best part of his charm.&nbsp;
The theme is old, the matter well worn, the subject common to us
all; and most of us care nothing for a few facts more or less
unless they be romantically conveyed.&nbsp; Reality is but the
beginning, the raw material, of art; and it is by the
artist&rsquo;s aid and countenance that we are used to make
acquaintance with our fellows, be they <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>generals in
cocked hats or mechanics in fustian.&nbsp; Now Jefferies was not
an artist, and so beside his stoats and hares, his pike, his
rabbits, and his moles, his men and women are of little
moment.&nbsp; You seem to have heard of them and to far better
purpose from others; you have had their author&rsquo;s facts
presented elsewhere, and that in picturesque conjunction with the
great eternal interests of passion and emotion.&nbsp; To be aware
of such a difference is to resent it; and accordingly to read is
to know that Jefferies would have done well to leave Hodge and
Hodge&rsquo;s masters alone and keep to his beasts and birds and
fishes.</p>
<h3>The General.</h3>
<p>Is it not plain as the nose on your face that his admirers
admire him injudiciously?&nbsp; It is true, for instance, that he
is in a sense, &lsquo;too full&rsquo; (the phrase is Mr.
Besant&rsquo;s) for the generality of readers.&nbsp; But it is
also true that he is not nearly full enough: that they look for
conclusions while he is bent upon giving them only details: that
they clamour for a breath of inspiration while he is bent upon
emptying his note-book in decent English; that they persist in
demanding a motive, a leading idea, a justification, while he
with knowledge crammed is fixed in his resolve to tell them no
more than that there are milestones on the Dover Road, or <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>that there are so many nails of so many shapes and so
many colours in the pig-sty at the back of Coate Farm.&nbsp; They
prefer &lsquo;their geraniums in the conservatory.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They refuse, in any case, to call a &lsquo;picture&rsquo; that
which is only a long-drawn sequence of statements.&nbsp; They are
naturally inartistic, but they have the tradition of a long and
speaking series of artistic results, and instinctively they
decline to recognise as art the work of one who was plainly the
reverse of an artist.&nbsp; The artist is he who knows how to
select and to inspire the results of his selection.&nbsp;
Jefferies could do neither.&nbsp; He was a reporter of genius;
and he never got beyond reporting.&nbsp; To the average reader he
is wanting in the great essentials of excitement: he is prodigal
of facts, and he contrives to set none down so as to make one
believe in it for longer than the instant of perusal.&nbsp; From
his work the passionate human quality is not less absent than the
capacity of selection and the gift of inspiration, and all the
enthusiasm of all the enthusiasts of an enthusiastic age will not
make him and his work acceptable to the aforesaid average
reader.&nbsp; In letters he is as the ideal British
water-colourist in paint: the care of both is not art but facts,
and again facts, and facts ever.&nbsp; You consider their work;
you cannot see the wood for the trees; and you are fain to
conclude that themselves were so much interested in the trees
they did not even know the wood was there.</p>
<h3><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Last Words.</h3>
<p>To come to an end with the man:&mdash;his range was very
limited, and within that range his activity was excessive; yet
the consequences of his enormous effort were&mdash;and
are&mdash;a trifle disappointing.&nbsp; He thought, poor fellow!
that he had the world in his hand and the public at his feet;
whereas, the truth to tell, he had only the empire of a kind of
back garden and the lordship of (as Mr. Besant has told us) some
forty thousand out of a hundred millions of readers.&nbsp; You
know that he suffered greatly; you know too that to the last he
worked and battled on as became an honest, much-enduring,
self-admiring man: as you know that in death he snatched a kind
of victory, and departed this life with dignity as one
&lsquo;good at many things,&rsquo; who had at last
&lsquo;attained to be at rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know, in a word,
that he took his part in the general struggle for existence, and
manfully did his best; and it is with something like a pang that
you find his biographer insisting on the merits of the feat, and
quoting approvingly the sentimentalists who gathered about his
death-bed.&nbsp; To make eloquence about heroism is not the way
to breed heroes; and it may be that Jefferies, had his last
environment been less fluent and sonorous, would now seem
something more heroic than he does.</p>
<h2><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>GAY</h2>
<h3>The Fabulist.</h3>
<p>Gay the fabulist is only interesting in a certain sense and to
a small extent.&nbsp; The morality of the <i>Fables</i> is
commonplace; their workmanship is only facile and agreeable; as
literature&mdash;as achievements in a certain order of
art&mdash;they have a poor enough kind of existence.&nbsp; In
comparison to the work of La Fontaine they are the merest
journalism.&nbsp; The simplicity, the wit, the wisdom, the
humanity, the dramatic imagination, the capacity of dramatic
expression, the exquisite union of sense and manner, the
faultless balance of matter and style, are qualities for which in
the Englishman you look in vain.&nbsp; You read, and you read not
only without enthusiasm but without interest.&nbsp; The verse is
merely brisk and fluent; the invention is common; the wit is not
very witty; the humour is artificial; the wisdom, the morality,
the knowledge of life, the science of character&mdash;if they
exist at all it is but as anatomical preparations or plants in a
<i>hortus siccus</i>.&nbsp; Worse than anything, the
<i>Fables</i> are monotonous.&nbsp; The manner is consistently
uniform; the invention has the level sameness of a Lincolnshire
landscape; the narrative moves with the equal <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>pace of
boats on a Dutch canal.&nbsp; The effect is that of a host of
flower-pots, the columns in a ledger, a tragedy by the Rev. Mr.
Home; and it is heightened by the matchless triteness of the
fabulist&rsquo;s reflections and the uncommon tameness of his
drama.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that this is indeed the Gay of
<i>Polly</i> and <i>The Beggars&rsquo; Opera</i>.&nbsp; True, the
dialects of his Peachum and his Lockit are in some sort one; his
gentlemen of the road and his ladies of the kennel rejoice in a
common flippancy of expression; there is little to choose between
the speech of Polly and the speech of Lucy.&nbsp; But in respect
of the essentials of drama the dialogue of the <i>Beggars&rsquo;
Opera</i> is on the whole sufficient.&nbsp; The personages are
puppets; but they are individual, and they are fairly consistent
in their individuality.&nbsp; Miss Lockit does not think and feel
like Miss Diver; Macheath is distinguishable from Peachum; none
is exactly alive, but of stage life ail have their share.&nbsp;
The reverse of this is the case with the personages of the
<i>Fables</i>.&nbsp; They think the thoughts and speak the speech
of Mr. Gay.&nbsp; The elephant has the voice of the sparrow; the
monkey is one with the organ on which he sits; there is but a
difference of name between the eagle and the hog; the talk of
Death has exactly the manner and weight and cadence of the
Woodman&rsquo;s; a change of label would enable the lion to
change places with the spaniel, would suffice to cage the wolf as
a bird and set free the parrot as a beast of <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>prey.&nbsp;
All are equally pert, brisk, and dapper in expression; all are
equally sententious and smart in aim; all are absolutely
identical in function and effect.&nbsp; The whole gathering is
stuffed with the same straw, prepared with the same dressing,
ticketed in the same handwriting, and painted with the same
colours.&nbsp; Any one who remembers the infinite variety of La
Fontaine will feel that Gay the fabulist is a writer whose work
the world has let die very willingly indeed.</p>
<h3>The Moralist.</h3>
<p>And Gay is not a whit less inefficient as a moralist.&nbsp; He
is a kindly soul, and in his easygoing way he has learnt
something of the tricks of the world and something of the hearts
of men.&nbsp; He writes as an unsuccessful courtier; and in that
capacity he has remarks to offer which are not always valueless,
and in which there is sometimes a certain shrewdness.&nbsp; But
the unsuccessful courtier is on the whole a creature of the
past.&nbsp; Such interest as he has is rather historical than
actual; and neither in the nursery nor in the schoolroom is he
likely to create any excitement or be received with any
enthusiasm.&nbsp; To the world he can only recommend himself as
one anxious to <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>make it known on the smallest
provocation and on any occasion or none that Queen Anne is
dead.&nbsp; Open him where you will, and you find him full of
this important news and determined on imparting it.&nbsp; Thus,
in <i>The Scold and the Parrot</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One slander must ten thousand get,<br />
The world with int&rsquo;rest pays the debt&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is to say, Queen Anne is dead.&nbsp; Thus, too, in <i>The
Persian</i>, <i>the Sun</i>, <i>and the Cloud</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The gale arose; the vapour tost<br />
(The sport of winds) in air was lost;<br />
The glorious orb the day refines.<br />
Thus envy breaks, thus merit shines&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in <i>The Goat without a Beard</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Coxcombs distinguished from the rest<br />
To all but coxcombs are a jest&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in <i>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Dog and the Wolf</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;An open foe may prove a curse,<br />
But a pretended friend is worse&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so to the end of the chapter.&nbsp; The theme is not
absorbing, and the variations are proper to the theme.</p>
<h3>After All.</h3>
<p>How long is it that the wise and good have ceased to say
(striking their pensive bosoms), &lsquo;<i>Here</i> lies <!--
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Gay&rsquo;?&nbsp; It is&mdash;how long?&nbsp; But for
all that Gay is yet a figure in English letters.&nbsp; As a
song-writer he has still a claim on us, and is still able to
touch the heart and charm the ear.&nbsp; The lyrics in <i>Acis
and Galatea</i> are not unworthy their association with
Handel&rsquo;s immortal melodies, the songs in <i>The
Beggars&rsquo; Opera</i> have a part in the life and fame of the
sweet old tunes from which they can never be divided.&nbsp; I
like to believe that in the operas and the <i>Trivia</i> and
<i>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Week</i> is buried the material of a
pleasant little book.</p>
<h2><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>ESSAYS AND ESSAYISTS</h2>
<h3>The Good of Them.</h3>
<p>It is our misfortune that of good essayists there should be
but few.&nbsp; Men there have been who have done the
essayist&rsquo;s part so well as to have earned an immortality in
the doing; but we have had not many of them, and they make but a
poor figure on our shelves.&nbsp; It is a pity that things should
be thus with us, for a good essayist is the pleasantest companion
imaginable.&nbsp; There are folk in plenty who have never read
Montaigne at all; but there are few indeed who have read but a
page of him, and that page but once.&nbsp; And the same may be
said of Addison and Fielding, of Lamb and Hazlitt, of Sterne and
Bacon and Ben Jonson, and all the members of their goodly
fellowship.&nbsp; To sit down with any one of them is to sit down
in the company of one of the &lsquo;mighty wits, our elders and
our betters,&rsquo; who have done much to make literature a good
thing, having written books that are eternally readable.&nbsp; If
of all them that have tried to write essays and succeeded after a
fashion a twentieth part so much could be said the world would
have a conversational literature of inexhaustible interest.&nbsp;
But indeed there is <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Beside
the &lsquo;rare and radiant&rsquo; masters of the art there are
the apprentices, and these are many and dull.</p>
<h3>Generalities.</h3>
<p>Essayists, like poets, are born and not made, and for one
worth remembering the world is confronted with a hundred not
worth reading.&nbsp; Your true essayist is in a literary sense
the friend of everybody.&nbsp; As one of the brotherhood has
phrased it, it is his function &lsquo;to speak with ease and
opportunity to all men.&rsquo;&nbsp; He must be personal, or his
hearers can feel no manner of interest in him.&nbsp; He must be
candid and sincere, or his readers presently see through
him.&nbsp; He must have learned to think for himself and to
consider his surroundings with an eye that is both kindly and
observant, or they straightway find his company
unprofitable.&nbsp; He should have fancy, or his starveling
propositions will perish for lack of metaphor and the tropes and
figures needed to vitalise a truism.&nbsp; He does well to have
humour, for humour makes men brothers, and is perhaps more
influential in an essay than in most places else.&nbsp; He will
find a little wit both serviceable to himself and comfortable to
his readers.&nbsp; For wisdom, it is not absolutely <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>necessary that he have it, but in its way it is as good
a property as any: used with judgment, indeed, it does more to
keep an essay sweet and fresh than almost any other
quality.&nbsp; And in default of wisdom&mdash;which, to be sure,
it is not given to every man, much less to every essayist, to
entertain&mdash;he need have no scruples about using whatever
common sense is his; for common sense is a highly respectable
commodity, and never fails of a wide and eager circle of
buyers.&nbsp; A knowledge of men and of books is also to be
desired; for it is a writer&rsquo;s best reason of being, and
without it he does well to hold his tongue.&nbsp; Blessed with
these attributes he is an essayist to some purpose.&nbsp; Give
him leisure and occasion, and his discourse may well become as
popular as Montaigne&rsquo;s own.</p>
<h3>In Particular.</h3>
<p>For the British essayists, they are more talked about than
known.&nbsp; It is to be suspected that from the first their
reputation has greatly exceeded their popularity; and of late
years, in spite of the declamation of Macaulay and the very
literary enthusiasm of the artist of <i>Esmond</i> and <i>The
Virginians</i>, they have fallen further into the background, and
are less <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>than ever studied with regard.&nbsp;
In theory the age of Anne is still the Augustan age to us; but in
theory only, and only to a certain extent.&nbsp; What attracts us
is its outside.&nbsp; We are in love with its houses and its
china and its costumes.&nbsp; We are not enamoured of it as it
was but as it seems to Mr. Caldecott and Mr. Dobson and Miss Kate
Greenaway.&nbsp; We care little for its comedy and nothing at all
for its tragedy.&nbsp; Its verse is all that our own is not, and
the same may be said of its prose and ours&mdash;of the prose of
Mr. Swinburne and Mr. George Meredith and the prose of Addison
and Swift.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone is not a bit like Bolingbroke, and
between <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Tatler</i>, between <i>The
Spectator</i> (Mr. Addison&rsquo;s), and <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>, there is a difference of close upon two centuries and
of a dozen revolutions&mdash;political, social, scientific, and
&aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; We may babble as we please about the
&lsquo;sweetness&rsquo; of Steele and the &lsquo;humour&rsquo; of
Sir Roger de Coverley, but in our hearts we care for them a great
deal less than we ought, and in fact Mr. Mudie&rsquo;s
subscribers do not hesitate to prefer the &lsquo;sweetness&rsquo;
of Mr. Black and the &lsquo;humour&rsquo; of Mr. James
Payn.&nbsp; Our love is not for the essentials of the time but
only its accidents and oddities; and we express it in pictures
and poems and fantasies in architecture, and the canonisation (in
figures) of Chippendale and Sheraton.&nbsp; But it is
questionable if we might not with advantage increase <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>our interest, and carry imitation a little
deeper.&nbsp; The Essayists, for instance, are often dull, but
they write like scholars and gentlemen.&nbsp; They refrain from
personalities; they let scandal alone, nor ever condescend to
eavesdropping; they never go out of their way in search of
affectation or prurience or melancholy, but are content to be
merely wise and cheerful and humane.&nbsp; Above all, they do
their work as well as they can.&nbsp; They seem to write not for
bread nor for a place in society but for the pleasure of writing,
and of writing well.&nbsp; In these hysterical times life is so
full, so much is asked and so much has to be given, that tranquil
writing and careful workmanship are impossible.&nbsp; A certain
poet has bewailed the change in a charming rondeau:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;More swiftly now the hours take flight!<br
/>
What&rsquo;s read at morn is dead at night;<br />
Scant space have we for art&rsquo;s delays,<br />
Whose breathless thought so briefly stays,<br />
We may not work&mdash;ah! would we might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With slower pen!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be owned that his melancholy is anything but
groundless.&nbsp; The trick of amenity and good breeding is lost;
the graces of an excellence that is unobtrusive are graces no
more.&nbsp; We write as men paint for the exhibitions: with the
consciousness that we must pass without notice if we do not
exceed in colour and subject and tone.&nbsp; The need exists, and
the world bows to it.&nbsp; Mr. Austin Dobson&rsquo;s little
sheaf of <i>Eighteenth Century Essays</i> might <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>be
regarded as a protest against the necessity and the
submission.&nbsp; It proves that &rsquo;tis possible to be
eloquent without adjectives and elegant without affectation; that
to be brilliant you need not necessarily be extravagant and
conceited; that without being maudlin and sentimental it is not
beyond mortal capacity to be pathetic; and that once upon a time
a writer could prove himself a humourist without feeling it
incumbent upon him to be also a jack-pudding.</p>
<h2><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>BOSWELL</h2>
<h3>His Destiny.</h3>
<p>It has been Boswell&rsquo;s fate to be universally read and
almost as universally despised.&nbsp; What he suffered at the
hands of Croker and Macaulay is typical of his fortune.&nbsp; In
character, in politics, in attainments, in capacity, the two were
poles apart; but they were agreed in this: that Boswell must be
castigated and contemned, and that they were the men to do
it.&nbsp; Croker&rsquo;s achievement, consider it how you will,
remains the most preposterous in literary history.&nbsp; He could
see nothing in the <i>Life</i> but a highly entertaining
compilation greatly in need of annotation and correction.&nbsp;
Accordingly he took up Boswell&rsquo;s text and interlarded it
with scraps of his own and other people&rsquo;s; he pegged into
it a sophisticated version of the <i>Tour</i>; and he overwhelmed
his amazing compound with notes and commentaries in which he took
occasion to snub, scold, &lsquo;improve,&rsquo; and insult his
author at every turn.&nbsp; What came of it one knows.&nbsp;
Macaulay, in the combined interests of Whiggism and good
literature, made Boswell&rsquo;s quarrel his own, and the
expiation was as bitter as the offence was wanton and
scandalous.</p>
<h3><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>His Critic.</h3>
<p>But Macaulay, if he did Jeddart justice on Croker, took care
not to forget that Johnson was a Tory hero, and that Boswell was
Johnson&rsquo;s biographer.&nbsp; He was too fond of good reading
not to esteem the <i>Life</i> for one of the best of books.&nbsp;
But he was also a master of the art of brilliant and picturesque
misrepresentation; and he did not neglect to prove that the
<i>Life</i> is only admirable because Boswell was
contemptible.&nbsp; It was, he argued, only by virtue of being at
once daft and drunken, selfish and silly, an eavesdropper and a
talebearer, a kind of inspired Faddle, a combination of butt and
lackey and snob, that Boswell contrived to achieve his wretched
immortality.&nbsp; And in the same way Boswell&rsquo;s hero was
after all but a sort of Grub Street Cyclops, respectable enough
by his intelligence&mdash;(but even so ridiculous in comparison
to gifted Whigs)&mdash;yet more or less despicable in his
manners, his English, and his politics.&nbsp; Now, Macaulay was
the genius of special pleading.&nbsp; Admirable man of letters as
he was, he was politician first and man of letters afterwards:
his judgments are no more final than his antitheses are dull, and
his method for all its brilliance is the reverse of sound.&nbsp;
When you begin to inquire how much he really knew about Boswell,
and how far you may accept his own estimate of his own
pretentions, he becomes amusing in spite of himself: much as,
according <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>to him, Boswell was an artist.&nbsp;
In his review of Croker he is keen enough about dates and facts
and solecisms; on questions of this sort he bestows his fiercest
energies; for such lapses he visits his Tory opposite with his
most savage and splendid insolence, his heartiest contempt, his
most scathing rhetoric.&nbsp; But on the great question of
all&mdash;the corruption of Boswell&rsquo;s text&mdash;he is not
nearly so implacable, and concerning the foisting on the
<i>Life</i> of the whole bulk of the <i>Tour</i> he is not more
than lukewarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;We greatly doubt,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;whether <i>even</i> the <i>Tour to the Hebrides</i> should
have been inserted in the midst of the <i>Life</i>.&nbsp; There
is one marked distinction between the two works.&nbsp; Most of
the <i>Tour</i> was seen by Johnson in manuscript.&nbsp; It does
not appear that he ever saw any part of the
<i>Life</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is to say that Croker&rsquo;s
action is reprehensible not because it is an offence against art
but because Johnson on private and personal grounds might not
have been disposed to accept the <i>Life</i> as representative
and just, and might have refused to sanction its appearance on an
equal footing with the <i>Tour</i>, which on private and personal
grounds he <i>had</i> accepted.&nbsp; In the face of such an
argument who can help suspecting Macaulay&rsquo;s artistic
faculty?&nbsp; &lsquo;The <i>Life of Johnson</i>,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;is assuredly a great, a very great, book.&nbsp; Homer is
not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakespeare is not
more decidedly the <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>first of dramatists, Demosthenes is
not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the
first of biographers . . . Eclipse is first, and the rest
nowhere.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is hearty and exact enough.&nbsp; But,
as I have hinted, Macaulay, furious with Croker&rsquo;s
carelessness, is almost tolerant of Croker&rsquo;s
impudence.&nbsp; For Croker as a scholar and an historian he is
merely pitiless; to Croker ruining the <i>Life</i> by the
insertion of the <i>Tour</i>&mdash;a feat which would scarce be
surpassed by the interpolation of the Falstaff scenes of the
<i>Merry Wives</i> in one or other of the parts of <i>Henry
IV.</i>&mdash;he is lenient enough, and lenient on grounds which
are not artistic but purely moral.&nbsp; Did he recognise to the
full the fact of Boswell&rsquo;s pre-eminence as an artist?&nbsp;
Was he really conscious that the <i>Life</i> is an admirable work
of art as well as the most readable and companionable of
books?&nbsp; As, not content with committing himself thus far, he
goes on to prove that Boswell was great because he was little,
that he wrote a great book because he was an ass, and that if he
had not been an ass his book would probably have been at least a
small one, incredulity on these points becomes respectable.</p>
<h3><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Himself.</h3>
<p>Boswell knew better.&nbsp; A true Scotsman and a true artist,
he could play the fool on occasion, and he could profit by his
folly.&nbsp; In his dedication to the first and greatest
President the Royal Academy has had he anticipates a good many of
Macaulay&rsquo;s objections to his character and deportment, and
proves conclusively that if he chose to seem ridiculous he did so
not unwittingly but with a complete apprehension of the effect he
designed and the means he adopted.&nbsp; In the <i>Tour</i>, says
he, from his &lsquo;eagerness to display the wonderful fertility
and readiness of Johnson&rsquo;s wit,&rsquo; he &lsquo;freely
showed to the world its dexterity, even when I was myself the
object of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was under the impression that he
would be &lsquo;liberally understood,&rsquo; as &lsquo;knowing
very well what I was about.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, he adds, &lsquo;it
seems I judged too well of the world&rsquo;; and he points his
moral with a story of &lsquo;the great Dr. Clarke,&rsquo; who,
&lsquo;unbending himself with a few friends in the most playful
and frolicsome manner,&rsquo; saw Beau Nash in the distance, and
was instantly sobered.&nbsp; &lsquo;My boys,&rsquo; quoth he,
&lsquo;let us be grave&mdash;here comes a fool.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Macaulay was not exactly Beau Nash, nor was Boswell &lsquo;the
great Dr. Clarke&rsquo;; but, as Macaulay, working on
Wolcot&rsquo;s lines, was presently to show, Boswell did right to
describe the world as &lsquo;a great fool,&rsquo; and to regret
in respect of his own silliness that in the <i>Tour</i> he had
been &lsquo;arrogant <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>enough to suppose that the tenour of
the rest of the book would sufficiently guard against such a
strange imputation.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the same way he showed
himself fully alive to the enduring merits of his
achievement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will venture to say,&rsquo; he
writes, &lsquo;that he (Johnson) will be seen in this work more
completely than any man who has ever lived.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had
his own idea of biography; he had demonstrated its value
triumphantly in the <i>Tour</i> which, though organically
complete, is plainly not a record of travel but a biographical
essay.&nbsp; In the <i>Tour</i>, that is, he had approved himself
an original master of selection, composition, and design; of the
art of working a large number of essential details into a uniform
and living whole; and of that most difficult and telling of
accomplishments, the reproduction of talk.&nbsp; In the
<i>Life</i> he repeated the proof on a larger scale and with a
finer mastery of construction and effect; and in what his best
editor describes as &lsquo;the task of correcting, amending, and
adding to his darling work&rsquo; he spent his few remaining
years.&nbsp; That he drifted into greatness, produced his two
masterpieces unconsciously, and developed a genius for biography
as one develops a disease, is &lsquo;a ridiculous
conception,&rsquo; as Mr. Napier rightly says.&nbsp; In proof of
it we have Boswell&rsquo;s own words, and we have the books
themselves.&nbsp; Such testimony is not to be overborne by any
number of paradoxes, however ingenious, nor by any <!-- page
200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>superflux of rhetoric, however plausible and
persuasive.&nbsp; That Boswell was a gossip, a busybody, and
something of a sot, and that many did and still do call him fool,
is certain; but that is no reason why he should not have been an
artist, and none why he should be credited with the fame of
having devoted the best part of his life to the production of a
couple of masterpieces&mdash;as M. Jourdain talked
prose&mdash;without knowing what he was doing.&nbsp; Turner chose
to go a-masquerading as &lsquo;Puggy Booth&rsquo;; but as yet
nobody has put forward the assertion that Turner was unconscious
of the romance and splendour of his <i>Ulysses and
Polyphemus</i>, or that he painted his <i>Rain</i>, <i>Speed</i>,
<i>and Steam</i> in absolute ignorance of the impression it would
produce and the idea it should convey.&nbsp; Goldsmith reminded
Miss Reynolds of &lsquo;a low mechanic, particularly . . . a
journey-man tailor&rsquo;; but that he was unconsciously the most
elegant and natural writer of his age is a position which has not
yet been advanced.&nbsp; And surely it is high time that Boswell
should take that place in art which is his by right of conquest,
and that Macaulay&rsquo;s paradox&mdash;which is only the opinion
brilliantly put of an ignorant and unthinking
world&mdash;(&lsquo;Il avait mieux que personne l&rsquo;esprit de
tout le monde&rsquo;)&mdash;should go the way of all its
kind.</p>
<h2><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>CONGREVE</h2>
<h3>His Biographers and Critics.</h3>
<p>An American literary journal once assured its readers that
Congreve has a &lsquo;niche in the Valhalla of Ben
Jonson.&rsquo;&nbsp; The remark is injudicious, of course, even
for a literary American, and there is no apparent reason why it
should ever have got itself uttered.&nbsp; It is probably the
unluckiest thing that ever was said of Congreve, who&mdash;with
some unimportant exceptions&mdash;has been singularly fortunate
in his critics and biographers.&nbsp; Dryden wrote of him with
enthusiasm, and in doing so he may be said to have set a fashion
of admiration which is vigorous and captivating even yet.&nbsp;
Swift, Voltaire, Lamb, Hunt, Hazlitt, Thackeray, Macaulay, to
name but these, have dealt with him in their several ways; of
late he has been praised by such masters of the art of writing as
Mr. Swinburne and Mr. George Meredith; while Mr. Gosse, the last
on the list, surpasses most of his predecessors in admiration and
nearly all, I think, in knowledge.</p>
<h3><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>The Real Congreve.</h3>
<p>It is no fault of Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s that with all his
diligence he should fail to give a complete and striking portrait
of his man, or to make more of what he describes as his
&lsquo;smiling, faultless rotundity.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he puts it:
&lsquo;There were no salient points about Congreve&rsquo;s
character,&rsquo; so that &lsquo;no vagaries, no escapades place
him in a ludicrous or in a human light,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he
passes through the literary life of his time as if in felt
slippers, noiseless, unupbraiding, without personal
adventures.&rsquo;&nbsp; That, I take it, is absolutely
true.&nbsp; It is known that Congreve was cheerful, serviceable,
and witty; that he was a man of many friends; that Pope dedicated
his <i>Iliad</i> to him; that Dryden loved and admired him; that
Collier attacked his work, and that his rejoinder was equally
spiritless and ill-bred; that he was attached to Mrs.
Bracegirdle, and left all his money to the Duchess of
Marlborough; that he was a creditable Government official; and
that at thirty, having written a certain number of plays, he
suddenly lost his interest in life and art, and wrote no
more.&nbsp; But that is about all.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s
picture of him may be, and probably is, as unveracious as his
Fielding or his Dick Steele; but there is little or nothing to
show how far we can depend upon it.&nbsp; The character of the
man escapes us, and we have either to refrain from trying to see
him or to content ourselves with mere hypothesis.&nbsp; So
abnormal <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>is the mystery in which he is
enshrouded that what in the case of others would be notorious
remains in his case dubious and obscure: so that we cannot tell
whether he was Bracegirdle&rsquo;s lover or only her friend, and
the secret of his relations with the Duchess of Marlborough has
yet to be discovered.&nbsp; Mr. Gosse succeeded no better than
they that went before in plucking out the heart of
Congreve&rsquo;s mystery.&nbsp; He was, and he remains,
impersonal.&nbsp; At his most substantial he is (as some one said
of him) no more than &lsquo;vagueness personified&rsquo;: at his
most luminous only an appearance like the <i>Scin-Laeca</i>, the
shining shadow adapted in a moment of peculiar inspiration by the
late Lord Lytton.</p>
<h3>The Dramatist.</h3>
<p>But we have the plays, and who runs may read and admire.&nbsp;
I say advisedly who runs may read, and not who will may
see.&nbsp; Congreve&rsquo;s plays are, one can imagine, as dull
in action as they are entertaining in print.&nbsp; They have
dropped out of the <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i>, and the truth is
they merit no better fate.&nbsp; They are only plays to the
critic of style; to the actor and the average spectator they are
merely so much spoken weariness.&nbsp; To begin with, they are
marked by such a deliberate and immitigable baseness of <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>morality as makes them impossible to man.&nbsp;
Wycherley has done more vilely; Vanbrugh soars to loftier
altitudes of filthiness.&nbsp; But neither Wycherley nor Vanbrugh
has any strain of the admirable intellectual quality of
Congreve.&nbsp; Villainy comes natural to the one, and
beastliness drops from the other as easily as honey from the
comb; but in neither is there evident that admirable effort of
the intelligence which is a distinguishing characteristic of
Congreve, and with neither is the result at once so consummate
and so tame.&nbsp; For both Wycherley and Vanbrugh are
playwrights, and Congreve is not.&nbsp; Congreve is only an
artist in style writing for himself and half a dozen in the pit,
while Wycherley and Vanbrugh&mdash;and for that matter Etherege
and Farquhar&mdash;are playwrights producing for the whole
theatre.&nbsp; In fact Congreve&rsquo;s plays were only
successful in proportion as they were less literary and
&lsquo;Congrevean.&rsquo;&nbsp; His first comedy was the talk of
the town; his last, <i>The Way of the World</i>, that monument of
characterisation (of a kind) and fine English, was only a
&lsquo;success of esteem.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason is not far to
seek.&nbsp; Congreve&rsquo;s plays were too sordid in conception
and too unamusing in effect for even the audiences to which they
were produced; they were excellent literature, but they were bad
drama, and they were innately detestable to boot.&nbsp; Audiences
are the same in all strata of time; and it is easy to see that
Wycherley&rsquo;s Horner and Vanbrugh&rsquo;s Sir John and Lady
Brute <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>were amusing, when Lady Wishfort and
Sir Sampson Legend and the illustrious and impossible Maskwell
were found &lsquo;old, cold, withered, and of intolerable
entrails.&rsquo;&nbsp; An audience, whatever its epoch, wants
action; and still action, and again and for the last time action;
also it wants a point of departure that shall be something
tinctured with humanity, a touch of the human in the term of
everything, and at least a &lsquo;sort of a kind of a
strain&rsquo; of humanity in the progress of events from the one
point to the other.&nbsp; This it gets in Wycherley, brute as he
is; with a far larger and more vigorous comic sense it gets the
same in Vanbrugh; it gets it with a difference in the
light-hearted indecencies of Farquhar.&nbsp; From the magnificent
prose of Congreve it is absent.&nbsp; His it was to sublimate all
that was most artificial in an artificial state of society: he
was the consummate artist of a phase that was merely transient,
the laureate of a generation that was only alive for half-an-hour
in the course of all the twenty-four.&nbsp; He is saved from
oblivion by sheer strength of style.&nbsp; It is a bad dramatic
style, as we know; it leaves the Witwoulds and the Plyants as
admirable as the Mirabels and Millamants and Angelicas; it makes
no distinction between the Mrs. Foresights and the Sir Sampson
Legends; it presents an exemplar in Lady Wishfort and an exemplar
in Petulant; it is uneasy, self-conscious, intrusive, even
offensive, the very reverse of dramatic; and in Congreve&rsquo;s
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>hands it is irresistible, for, thanks to Congreve, it
has been forced from the stage, and lives as literature
alone.</p>
<h3>The Writer.</h3>
<p>Congreve was essentially a man of letters; his style is that
of a pupil not of Moli&egrave;re but of the full, the rich, the
excessive, the pedantic Jonson; his Legends, his Wishforts, his
Foresights are the lawful heirs&mdash;refined and sublimated but
still of direct descent&mdash;of the Tuccas and the Bobadils and
the Epicure Mammons of the great Elizabethan; they are (that is)
more literary than theatrical&mdash;they are excellent reading,
but they have long since fled the stage and vanished into the
night of mere scholarship.&nbsp; To compare an author of this
type and descent to Shakespeare is a trifle unfair; to compare
him to Moli&egrave;re is to misapprehend the differences between
pure literature and literature that is also drama.&nbsp;
Congreve, as I have said, has disappeared from the boards, and is
only tolerable or even intelligible to the true reader; while
Shakespeare worked on so imperfect a convention that, though he
keeps the stage and is known indeed for the poet of the most
popular play ever written&mdash;(for that, I take it,
<i>Hamlet</i> is)&mdash;he is yet the prey of every twopenny <!--
page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>actor, or actor-manager, or actor-manager-editor, who
is driven to deal with him.&nbsp; Now, Moli&egrave;re wrote as
one that was first of all a great actor; who dealt not so much
with what is transient in human life as with what is eternal in
human nature; who addressed himself much more to an
audience&mdash;(F&eacute;nelon who found fault with his style is
witness to the fact)&mdash;than to a circle of readers.&nbsp; And
the result is that Moli&egrave;re not only remains better reading
than Congreve, but is played at this time in the Rue de Richelieu
line for line and word for word as he was played at the
Palais-Bourbon over two hundred years ago.</p>

<h3>Its Romance.</h3>
<p>He that has the book of the <i>Thousand Nights and a Night</i>
has Hachisch-made-words for life.&nbsp; Gallant, subtle, refined,
intense, humourous, obscene, here is the Arab intelligence drunk
with conception.&nbsp; It is a vast extravaganza of passion in
action and picarooning farce and material splendour run
mad.&nbsp; The amorous instinct and the instinct of enjoyment,
not tempered but heightened greatly by the strict ordinances of
dogma, have leave to riot uncontrolled.&nbsp; It is the old
immortal story of Youth and Beauty and their coming together, but
it is coloured with the hard and brilliant hues of an imagination
as sensuous in type and as gorgeous in ambition as humanity has
known.&nbsp; The lovers must suffer, for suffering intensifies
the joy of fruition; so they are subjected to all such modes of
travail and estrangement as a fancy careless of pain and
indifferent to life can devise.&nbsp; But it is known that happy
they are to be; and if by the annihilation of time and space then
are space and time annihilated.&nbsp; Adventures are to the
adventurous all the world <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>over; but
they are so with a difference in the East.&nbsp; It is only
Sinbad that confesses himself devoured with the lust of
travel.&nbsp; The grip of a humourous and fantastic fate is tight
on all the other heroes of this epic-in-bits.&nbsp; They do not
go questing for accidents: their hour comes, and the finger of
God urges them forth, and thrusts them on in the way of
destiny.&nbsp; The air is horrible with the gross and passionate
figments of Islamite mythology.&nbsp; Afrits watch over or molest
them; they are made captive of malignant Ghouls; the Jinns take
bodily form and woo them to their embraces.&nbsp; The sea-horse
ramps at them from the ocean floor; the great roc darkens earth
about them with the shadow of his wings; wise and goodly apes
come forth and minister unto them; enchanted camels bear them
over evil deserts with the swiftness of the wind, or the magic
horse outspreads his sail-broad vannes, and soars with them; or
they are borne aloft by some servant of the Spell till the earth
is as a bowl beneath them, and they hear the angels quiring at
the foot of the Throne.&nbsp; So they fare to strange and dismal
places: through cities of brass whose millions have perished by
divine decree; cities guilty of the cult of the Fire and the
Light wherein all life has been striken to stone; or on to the
magnetic mountain by whose horrible attraction the bolts are
drawn from the ship, and they alone survive the inevitable
wreck.&nbsp; And the end <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>comes.&nbsp; Comes the Castle of Burnished Copper, and
its gates fly open before them: the forty damsels, each one
fairer than the rest, troop out at their approach; they are
bathed in odours, clothed in glittering apparel, fed with
enchanted meats, plunged fathoms deep in the delights of the
flesh.&nbsp; There is contrived for them a private paradise of
luxury and splendour, a practical Infinite of gold and silver
stuffs and jewels and all things gorgeous and rare and costly;
and therein do they abide for evermore.&nbsp; You would say of
their poets that they contract immensity to the limits of desire;
they exhaust the inexhaustible in their enormous effort; they
stoop the universe to the slavery of a talisman, and bind the
visible and invisible worlds within the compass of a ring.</p>
<h3>Its Comedy.</h3>
<p>But there is another side to their imaginings.&nbsp; When the
Magian has done beating his copper drum&mdash;(how its mysterious
murmur still haunts the echoes of memory!)&mdash;when Queen Lab
has finished her tremendous conjurations, wonder gives place to
laughter, the apotheosis of the flesh to the spirit of
comedy.&nbsp; The enchanter turns harlequin; and what the lovers
ask is not the annihilation of time and space but only that the
father be at his <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>prayers, or the husband gone on a
fool&rsquo;s errand, while they have leave to kiss each
other&rsquo;s mouths, &lsquo;as a pigeon feedeth her
young,&rsquo; to touch the lute, strip language naked, and
&lsquo;repeat the following verses&rsquo; to a ring of laughing
girls and amid all such comfits and delicates as a hungry
audience may rejoice to hear enumerated.&nbsp; And the intrigue
begins, and therewith the presentment of character, the
portraiture of manners.&nbsp; Merry ladies make love to their
gallants with flowers, or scorn them with the huckle-bones of
shame; the Mother Coles of Araby pursue the unwary stranger for
their mistress&rsquo; pleasure; damsels resembling the full moon
carouse with genial merchants or inquiring calenders.&nbsp; The
beast of burden, even the porter, has his hour: he goes the round
at the heels of a veiled but beautiful lady, and lays her in the
materials of as liberal and sumptuous a carouse as is recorded in
history.&nbsp; Happy lady, and O thrice-fortunate porter!
enviable even to the term of time!&nbsp; It is a voluptuous
farce, a masque and anti-masque of wantonness and stratagem, of
wine-cups and jewels and fine raiment, of gaudy nights and
amorous days, of careless husbands and adventurous wives, of
innocent fathers and rebel daughters and lovers happy or
befooled.&nbsp; And high over all, his heart contracted with the
spleen of the East, the tedium of supremacy, towers the great
Caliph Haroun, the buxom and bloody tyrant, a Muslim Lord of <!--
page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Misrule.&nbsp; With Giafar, the finest gentleman and
goodliest gallant of Eastern story, and Mesrour, the
well-beloved, the immortal Eunuch, he goes forth upon his round
in the enchanted streets of Bagd&agrave;d, like Fran&ccedil;ois
Premier in the maze of old-time Paris.&nbsp; The night is musical
with happy laughter and the sound of lutes and voices; it is
seductive with the clink of goblets and the odour of perfumes:
not a shadow but has its secret, or jovial or amorous or
terrible: here falls a head, and there you may note the
contrapuntal effect of the bastinado.&nbsp; But the blood is
quickly hidden with flowers, the bruises are tired over with
cloth-of-gold, and the jolly pageant sweeps on.&nbsp; Truly the
comic essence is imperishable.&nbsp; What was fun to them in
Baghdad is fun to us in London after a thousand years.</p>
<h3>Sacer Vates.</h3>
<p>The prose of Mr. Payne&rsquo;s translation is always readable
and often elegant; Sir Richard Burton&rsquo;s notes and
&lsquo;terminal essays&rsquo; are a mine of curious and diverting
information; but for me the real author of <i>The Arabian
Nights</i> is called not Burton nor Payne but Antoine
Galland.&nbsp; He it was, in truth, who gave the world as much
exactly as it needed of his preposterous original: who eliminated
its <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>tediousness, purged it of its
barbarous and sickening immorality, wiped it clean of cruelty and
unnaturalness, selected its essentials of comedy and romance, and
set them clear and sharp against a light that western eyes can
bear and in an atmosphere that western lungs can breathe.&nbsp;
Of course the new translations are interesting&mdash;especially
to ethnologists and the critic with a theory that translated
verse is inevitably abominable.&nbsp; But they are not for the
general nor the artist.&nbsp; They include too many pages
revolting by reason of unutterable brutality of incident and
point of view&mdash;as also for the vileness of those lewd and
dreadful puritans whose excesses against humanity and whose
devotion to Islam they record&mdash;to be acceptable as
literature or tolerable as reading.&nbsp; Now, in Galland I get
the best of them.&nbsp; He gave me whatever is worth remembering
of Bedreddin and Camaralzaman and that enchanting Fairy
Peri-Banou; he is the true poet alike of Abou Hassan and the
Young King of the Black Islands, of Ali Baba and the Barber of
the Brothers; to him I owe that memory&mdash;of Zobeid&egrave;
alone in the accursed city whose monstrous silence is broken by
the voice of the one man spared by the wrath of God as he repeats
his solitary prayer&mdash;which ranks with Crusoe&rsquo;s
discovery of the footprint in the thrilling moments of my life;
it was he who, by refraining from the use of pepper in his cream
tarts, contrived to kitchen those confections with the very
essence <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>of romance; it was he that clove
asunder the Sultan&rsquo;s kitchen-wall for me, and took me to
the pan, and bade me ask a certain question of the fish that
fried therein, and made them answer me in terms mysterious and
tremendous yet.&nbsp; Nay, that animating and delectable feeling
I cherish ever for such enchanted commodities as gold-dust and
sandal-wood and sesame and cloth of gold and black slaves with
scimitars&mdash;to whom do I owe it but this rare and delightful
artist?&nbsp; &lsquo;O mes chers <i>Mille et une
Nuits</i>!&rsquo; says Fantasio, and he speaks in the name of all
them that have lived the life that Galland alone made
possible.&nbsp; The damsels of the new style may &lsquo;laugh
till they fall backwards,&rsquo; etc., through forty volumes
instead of ten, and I shall still go back to my Galland.&nbsp; I
shall go back to him because his masterpiece is&mdash;not a book
of reference, nor a curiosity of literature, nor an achievement
in pedantry, nor even a demonstration of the absolute failure of
Islamism as an influence that makes for righteousness,
but&mdash;an excellent piece of art.</p>
<h2><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>RICHARDSON</h2>
<h3>His Fortune.</h3>
<p>It is many years since Richardson fell into desuetude; it is
many years since he became the novelist not of the world at large
but of that inconsiderable section of the world which is
interested in literature.&nbsp; His methods are those of a bygone
epoch; his ideals, with one or two exceptions, are old-fashioned
enough to seem fantastic; his sentiment belongs to ancient
history; to a generation bred upon Ouida&rsquo;s romances and the
plays of Mr. W. S. Gilbert his morality appears not merely
questionable but coarse and improper and repulsive.&nbsp; While
he lived he was adored: he moved and spoke and dwelt in an
eternal mist of &lsquo;good, thick, strong, stupefying incense
smoke&rsquo;; he was the idol of female England, a master of
virtue, a king of art, the wisest and best of mankind.&nbsp;
Johnson revered him&mdash;Johnson and Colley Gibber; Diderot
ranked him with Moses and Homer; to Balzac and Musset and George
Sand he was the greatest novelist of all time; Rousseau imitated
him; Macaulay wrote and talked of him with an enthusiasm that
would have sat becomingly on Lady Bradshaigh herself.&nbsp; <!--
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>But all that is over.&nbsp; Not even the emasculation
to which the late Mr. Dallas was pleased to subject his
<i>Clarissa</i> could make that <i>Clarissa</i> at all popular;
not all the allusions of all the leader-writers of a
leader-writing age have been able to persuade the public to renew
its interest in the works and ways of Grandison the august and
the lovely and high-souled Harriet Byron.&nbsp; Richardson has to
be not skimmed but studied; not sucked like an orange, nor
swallowed like a lollipop, but attacked <i>secundum artem</i>
like a dinner of many courses and wines.&nbsp; Once inside the
vast and solid labyrinth of his intrigue, you must hold fast to
the clue which you have caught up on entering, or the adventure
proves impossible, and you emerge from his precincts defeated and
disgraced.&nbsp; And by us children of Mudie, to whom a novel
must be either a solemn brandy-and-soda or as it were a garrulous
and vapid afternoon tea, adventures of that moment are not often
attempted.</p>
<h3>Pamela.</h3>
<p>Again, when all is said in Richardson&rsquo;s favour it has to
be admitted against him that in <i>Pamela</i> he produced an
essay in vulgarity&mdash;of sentiment and morality
alike&mdash;which has never been surpassed.&nbsp; In these days
it is hardly less difficult to understand the popularity of this
masterpiece of specious <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>immodesty
than to speak or think of it with patience.&nbsp; That it was
once thought moral is as wonderful as that it was once found
readable.&nbsp; What is more easily apprehended is the contempt
of Henry Fielding&mdash;is the justice of that ridicule he was
moved to visit it withal.&nbsp; To him, a scholar and a gentleman
and a man of the world, <i>Pamela</i> was a new-fangled blend of
sentimental priggishness and prurient unreality.&nbsp; To him the
pretensions to virtue and consideration of the vulgar little
hussy whom Richardson selected for his heroine were certainly not
less preposterous than the titles to life and actuality of the
wooden libertine whom Richardson put forth as his hero.&nbsp; He
was artist enough to know that the book was ignoble as literature
and absolutely false as fact; he was moralist enough to see that
its teachings were the reverse of elevating and improving; and he
uttered his conclusions <i>more suo</i> in one of the best and
healthiest books in English literature.&nbsp; This, indeed, is
the only merit of which the history of Miss Andrews can well be
accused: that it set Fielding thinking and provoked him to the
composition of the first of his three great novels.&nbsp; Pamela
is only remembered nowadays as Joseph&rsquo;s sister: the
egregious Mr. B--- has hardly any existence save as Lady
Booby&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an ill wind that blows
good to nobody.&nbsp; There are few more tedious or more
unpleasant experiences <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>than
<i>Pamela</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>Virtue Rewarded</i>.&nbsp; But you
have but to remember that without it the race might never have
heard of Fanny and Joseph, of the fair Slipslop and the ingenuous
Didapper, of Parson Trulliber and immortal Abraham Adams, to be
reconciled to its existence and the fact of its old-world
fame.&nbsp; Nay, more, to remember its ingenious author with
something of gratitude and esteem.</p>
<h3>Grandison.</h3>
<p>Nor is this the only charge that can be made and sustained
against our poet.&nbsp; It is also to be noted in his
disparagement that he is the author of <i>Sir Charles
Grandison</i>, and that <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, epic of the
polite virtues, is deadly dull.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; says
somebody in one of Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s books, &lsquo;your
eternal blue velvet quite tires me.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is the
worst of <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>: his eternal blue
velvet&mdash;his virtue, that is, his honour, his propriety, his
good fortune, his absurd command over the affections of the other
sex, his swordsmanship, his manliness, his patriotic sentiment,
his noble piety&mdash;quite tires you.&nbsp; He is an ideal, but
so very, very tame that it is hard to justify his
existence.&nbsp; He is too perfect to be of the slightest moral
use to anybody.&nbsp; He has everything he wants, so that he has
no temptation to be wicked; he is <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>incapable
of immorality, so that he is easily quit of all inducements to be
vicious; he has no passions, so that he is superior to every sort
of spiritual contest; he is monstrous clever, so that he has made
up his mind about everything knowable and unknowable; he is
excessively virtuous so that he has made it up in the right
direction.&nbsp; He is, as Mr. Leslie Stephen remarks, a tedious
commentary on the truth of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley&rsquo;s acute
reflection upon the moral effect of five thousand a year.&nbsp;
He is only a pattern creature, because he has neither need nor
opportunity, neither longing nor capacity, to be anything
else.&nbsp; In real life such faultless monsters are impossible:
one does not like to think what would happen if they were
not.&nbsp; In fiction they are possible enough, and&mdash;what is
more to the purpose&mdash;they are of necessity extravagantly
dull.&nbsp; This is what is the matter with Sir Charles.&nbsp; He
is dull, and he effuses dulness.&nbsp; By dint of being
uninteresting himself he makes his surroundings
uninteresting.&nbsp; In the record of his adventures and
experiences there is enough of wit and character and invention to
make the fortune of a score or more of such novels as the public
of these degenerate days would hail with enthusiasm.&nbsp; But
his function is to vitiate them all.&nbsp; He is a bore of the
first magnitude, and of his eminence in that capacity his history
is at once the monument and the proof.</p>
<h3>Clarissa.</h3>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>But if <i>Grandison</i> be dull and <i>Pamela</i>
contemptible <i>Clarissa</i> remains; and <i>Clarissa</i> is what
Musset called it, &lsquo;le premier roman du monde.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of course <i>Clarissa</i> has its faults.&nbsp; Miss Harlowe, for
instance, is not always herself&mdash;is not always the complete
creation she affects to be: there are touches of moral
pedantry&mdash;anticipations of George Eliot&mdash;in her; the
scenes in which she is brought to shame are scarcely real,
living, moving, all the rest of it.&nbsp; But on the other hand
is there anything better than Lovelace in the whole range of
fiction?&nbsp; Take Lovelace in all or any of his
moods&mdash;suppliant, intriguing, repentant, triumphant, above
all triumphant&mdash;and find his parallel if you can.&nbsp;
Where, you ask, did the little printer of Salisbury
Court&mdash;who suggests to Mr. Stephen &lsquo;a plump white
mouse in a wig&rsquo;&mdash;where did Richardson discover so much
gallantry and humanity, so much romance and so much fact, such an
abundance of the heroic qualities and the baser veracities of
mortal nature?&nbsp; Lovelace is, if you except Don Quixote, the
completest hero in fiction.&nbsp; He has wit, humour, grace,
brilliance, charm; he is a scoundrel and a ruffian, and he is a
gentleman and a man; of his kind and in his degree he has the
right Shakespearean quality.&nbsp; Almost as perfect in her way
is the enchanting Miss Howe&mdash;an incarnation of womanliness
and wit and fun, after Lovelace the most brilliant of
Richardson&rsquo;s <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>creations.&nbsp; Or take the Harlowe
family: the severe and stupid father, the angry and selfish
uncles, the cub James, the vixen Arabella, a very fiend of envy
and hatred and malice&mdash;what a gallery of portraits is
here!&nbsp; And Solmes and Tomlinson, Belford and Brand and
Hickman; and the infinite complexity of the intrigue; the wit,
the pathos, the invention; the knowledge of human nature; the
faculty of dialogue&mdash;where save in <i>Clarissa</i> shall we
find all these?&nbsp; As for Miss Harlowe herself, all incomplete
as she is she remains the Eve of fiction, the prototype of the
modern heroine, the common mother of all the self-contained,
self-suffering, self-satisfied young persons whose delicacies and
repugnances, whose independence of mind and body, whose airs and
ideas and imaginings, are the stuff of the modern novel.&nbsp;
With her begins a new ideal of womanhood; from her proceeds a
type unknown in fact and fiction until she came.&nbsp; When after
outrage she declines to marry her destroyer, and prefers death to
the condonation of her dishonour, she strikes a note and assumes
a position till then not merely unrecognised but absolutely
undiscovered.&nbsp; It has been said of her half in jest and half
in earnest that she is &lsquo;the aboriginal Woman&rsquo;s Rights
person&rsquo;; and it is a fact that she and Helena and Desdemona
and Ophelia are practically a thousand years apart.&nbsp; And
this is perhaps her finest virtue as it is certainly <!-- page
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>her greatest charm: that, until she set the example,
woman in literature as a self-suffering individuality, as an
existence endowed with equal rights to independence&mdash;of
choice, volition, action&mdash;with man, had not begun to
be.&nbsp; That of itself would suffice to make <i>Clarissa</i>
memorable; and that is the least of its merits.&nbsp; Consider it
from which point you will, the book remains a masterpiece, unique
of its kind.&nbsp; It has been imitated but it has never been
equalled.&nbsp; It is Richardson&rsquo;s only title to fame; but
it is enough.&nbsp; Not the Great Pyramid itself is more solidly
built nor more incapable of ruin.</p>
<h2><!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>TOLSTO&Iuml;</h2>
<h3>The Man and the Artist.</h3>
<p>There are two men in Tolsto&iuml;.&nbsp; He is a mystic and he
is also a realist.&nbsp; He is addicted to the practice of a
pietism that for all its sincerity is nothing if not vague and
sentimental; and he is the most acute and dispassionate of
observers, the most profound and earnest student of character and
emotion.&nbsp; These antitheses are both represented in his
novels.&nbsp; He has thought out the scheme of things for
himself; his interpretation, while deeply tinctured with
religion, is also largely and liberally human; he is one to the
just and the unjust alike, and he is no more angry with the
wicked than he is partial to the good.&nbsp; He asks but one
thing of his men and women&mdash;that they shall be natural; yet
he handles his humbugs and impostors with as cold a kindness and
a magnanimity as equable as he displays in his treatment of their
opposites.&nbsp; Indeed his interest in humanity is
inexhaustible, and his understanding of it is well nigh
formidable in its union of breadth with delicacy.&nbsp; Himself
an aristocrat and an official, he is able to sympathise with the
Russian peasant as completely and to express his sentiments as
perfectly as he is able <!-- page 224--><a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>to present
the characters and give utterance to the ambitions and the
idiosyncrasies of the class to which he belongs and might be
assumed to have studied best.&nbsp; It is to be noted, moreover,
that he looks for his material at one or other pole of
society.&nbsp; He is equally at home with officers and privates,
with diplomats and carpenters, with princes and ploughmen; but
with the intermediary strata he is out of touch, and he is
careful to leave the task of presenting them to others.&nbsp; It
is arguable that only in the highest and lowest expressions of
society is unsophisticated nature to be found; and that
Tolsto&iuml;, interested less in manners than in men and studious
above all of the elemental qualities of character, has done right
to avoid the middle-class and attach himself to the consideration
and the representation of the highest and the lowest.&nbsp;
Certain it is that here have been his successes.&nbsp; The Prince
Andrew of <i>War and Peace</i>&mdash;cultured, intelligent,
earnest, true lover and true gentleman&mdash;is as noble a hero
as modern fiction has achieved; but he is no more interesting as
a human being and no more successful as art than the Marianna of
<i>les Cosaques</i>, who is a savage pure and simple, or the Efim
of <i>les Deux Vieillards</i>, who would seem to the haughty
Radical no better than a common idiot.&nbsp; It is to be noted of
all three&mdash;the prince, the savage, and the
peasant&mdash;that none in himself is sophisticate nor vile but
that each is rich in the common, simple, elemental qualities of
<!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>humanity.&nbsp; It is to these and the manifestations
of these that Tolsto&iuml; turns for inspiration first of
all.&nbsp; If he chose he could be as keen a satirist and as
indefatigable a student of the meannesses and the minor miseries
of existence, the toothaches and the pimples of experience, as
Thackeray.&nbsp; But he does not choose.&nbsp; The epic note
sounds in his work.&nbsp; The eternal issues of life, the
fundamental interests of character and conduct and emotion, are
his material.&nbsp; Love, valour, self-sacrifice, charity, the
responsibilities of being, these and their like are the only
vital facts to him; they constitute the really important part of
the scheme of things as he sees and comprehends it.&nbsp; In
their analysis the artist and the mystic meet and take hands;
sometimes to each other&rsquo;s profit, more often, to each
other&rsquo;s hurt.&nbsp; It is not without significance that no
other novelist has looked so closely and penetrated so far into
the secret of death: that none has divined so much of it, nor
presented his results with so complete and intimate a mastery and
so persuasive and inspiring a belief.&nbsp; Plainly Tolsto&iuml;
has learned &lsquo;la vraie signification de la vie&rsquo;; his
faith in its capacities is immense, his acceptance of its
consequences is unhesitating.&nbsp; He is the great optimist, and
his work is wholesome and encouraging in direct ratio to the
vastness of his talent and the perfection of his method.</p>
<h3><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span> Ivan Iliitch.</h3>
<p>Who does not know that extraordinary <i>Death of Ivan
Iliitch</i>?&nbsp; It is an achievement in realism: not the
realism of externals and trivial details&mdash;though of this
there is enough for art if not for the common Zolaphyte&mdash;but
the higher and better sort, the realism which deals with mental
and spiritual conditions, the realism of <i>Othello</i> and
<i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; There are many deaths in literature, but
there is none, I think, in which the gradual processes of
dissolution are analysed and presented with such knowledge, such
force, such terrible directness, as here.&nbsp; The result is
appalling, but the final impression is one of encouragement and
consolation.&nbsp; Here, as everywhere, Tolsto&iuml; appeals to
the primitive nature of man, and the issue is what he wishes it
to be.&nbsp; Not for him is the barren pessimism of the
latter-day French rhapsodist in fiction, and the last word of his
study, inexorable till then, is a word of hope and faith.</p>
<h3>War and Peace.</h3>
<p>Incomparably his greatest book, however, is <i>War and
Peace</i>.&nbsp; It is the true Russian epic; alike in the
vastness of its scope and in the completeness of its
execution.&nbsp; It tells the story of the great conflict between
Koutouzoff and Russia and Napoleon and France, it begins some
years before Austerlitz, and it ends <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>when
Borodino and Moscow are already ancient history.&nbsp; The canvas
is immense: the crowd of figures and the world of incidents
almost bewildering.&nbsp; It is not a complete success.&nbsp; In
many places the mystic has got the better of the artist: he is
responsible for theories of the art of war which, advanced with
the greatest confidence, are disproved by the simple narrative of
events; and he has made a study of Napoleon in which, for the
first and only time in all his work, he appears as an intemperate
advocate.&nbsp; But when all is said in blame so much remains to
praise that one scarce knows where to begin.&nbsp;
Tolsto&iuml;&rsquo;s theory of war is mystical and untenable, no
doubt; but his pictures of warfare are incomparably good.&nbsp;
None has felt and reproduced as he has done what may be called
the intimacy of battle&mdash;the feeling of the individual
soldier, the passion and excitement, the terror and the fury,
that taken collectively make up the influence which represents
the advance or the retreat of an army in combat.&nbsp; But also,
in a far greater degree, none has dealt so wonderfully with the
vaster incidents, the more tremendous issues.&nbsp; His
Austerlitz is magnificent; his Borodino is (there is no other
word for it) epic; his studies of the Retreat are almost worthy
of what has gone before.&nbsp; For the first time what has been
called &lsquo;the peering modern touch&rsquo; is here applied to
great events, with the result that here is a book unique in
literature.&nbsp; Of the characters&mdash;Natasha, Peter, <!--
page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>Mary, Dennissoff, the Rostoffs, Helen, Dologhoff,
Bagration, Bolkonsky, and the others; above all, Koutouzoff and
Prince Andrew&mdash;Prince Andrew the heroic gentleman,
Koutouzoff the genius of Russia and the war&mdash;to meet them
once is to take on a set of friends and enemies for life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>FIELDING</h2>
<h3>Illusions.</h3>
<p>Fielding is one of the most striking figures in our literary
history, and he is one of the most popular as well.&nbsp; But it
is questionable if many people know very much about him after
all, or if the Fielding of legend&mdash;the potwalloper of genius
at whom we have smiled so often&mdash;has many things in common
with the Fielding of fact, the indefatigable student, the
vigorous magistrate, the great and serious artist.&nbsp; You hear
but little of him from himself; for with that mixture of
intellectual egoism and moral unselfishness which is a
characteristic of his large and liberal nature he was as careless
of Henry Fielding&rsquo;s sayings and doings and as indifferent
to the fact of Henry Fielding&rsquo;s life and personality as he
was garrulous in respect of the good qualities of Henry
Fielding&rsquo;s friends and truculently talkative about the
vices of Henry Fielding&rsquo;s enemies.&nbsp; And what is
exactly known people have somehow or other contrived to
misapprehend and misapply.&nbsp; They have preferred the evidence
of Horace Walpole to that of their own senses.&nbsp; They have
suffered the brilliant antitheses of Lady Mary to obscure and
blur the man as they might have found <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>him in his
work.&nbsp; Booth and Jones have been taken for definite and
complete reflections of the author of their being: the parts for
the whole, that is&mdash;a light-minded captain of foot and a
hot-headed and soft-hearted young man about town for adequate
presentments of the artist of a new departure and the writer of
three or four books of singular solidity and finish.&nbsp;
Whichever way you turn, you are confronted with appearances each
more distorted and more dubious than the other.&nbsp; Some have
chosen to believe the foolish fancies of Murphy, and have
pictured themselves a Fielding begrimed with snuff, heady with
champagne, and smoking so ferociously that out of the wrappings
of his tobacco he could keep himself in paper for the manuscripts
of his plays.&nbsp; For others the rancour of Smollett calls up a
Fielding who divides his time and energy between blowing a
trumpet on a Smithfield show and playing Captain Bilkum to a
flesh-and-blood Stormandra at the establishment of a living,
breathing, working Mother Punchbowl.&nbsp; With Dr. Rimbault and
Professor Henry Morley others yet evolve from their inner
consciousness a Fielding with a booth in Smithfield, buffooning
for the coppers of a Bartlemy Fair audience.&nbsp; The
accomplished lawyer has had as little place in men&rsquo;s
thoughts as the tender father, the admirable artist as little as
the devoted husband and the steadfast friend.&nbsp; Fielding has
been so often painted a hard drinker that few <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>have
thought of him as a hard reader; he has been suspected of
conjugal infidelity, so it has seemed impossible that he should
be other than a violent Bohemian.&nbsp; In certain chapters of
<i>Jonathan Wild the Great</i> there is enough of sustained
intellectual effort to furnish forth a hundred modern novels; but
you only think of Fielding reeling home from the Rose, and refuse
to consider him except as sitting down with his head in a wet
towel to scribble immodest and ruffianly trash for the
players!&nbsp; A consequence of all these exercises in sentiment
and imagination has been that, while many have been ready to deal
with Fielding as the text for a sermon or the subject of an
essay, as the point of a moral or the adornment of a tale, few
have cared to think of him as worthy to dispute the palm with
Cervantes and Sir Walter as the heroic man of letters.</p>
<h3>Facts.</h3>
<p>He is before all things else a writer to be studied.&nbsp; He
wrote for the world at large and to the end that he might be read
eternally.&nbsp; His matter, his manner, the terms of his
philosophy, the quality of his ideals, the nature of his
achievement, proclaim him universal.&nbsp; Like Scott, like
Cervantes, like Shakespeare, he claims not merely our
acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity.&nbsp; He
has no special public, and to be <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>only on
nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his
attraction and unworthy his society.&nbsp; He worked not for the
boys and girls of an age but for the men and women of all time;
and both as artist and as thinker he commands unending attention
and lifelong friendship.&nbsp; He is a great inventor, an
unrivalled craftsman, a perfect master of his material.&nbsp; His
achievement is the result of a life-time of varied experience, of
searching and sustained observation, of unwearying intellectual
endeavour.&nbsp; The sound and lusty types he created have an
intellectual flavour peculiar to themselves.&nbsp; His novels
teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and beneficent
examples.&nbsp; As Mr. Stephen tells you, &lsquo;he has the
undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary
society with a force and accuracy not even rivalled by any other
writer&rsquo;; and it is a fact that not to have studied him
&lsquo;is to be without a knowledge of the most important
documents of contemporary history.&rsquo;&nbsp; More: to contrast
those fair, large parchments in which he has stated his results
with those tattered and filthy papers which the latter-day
literary rag-picker exists but to grope out from kennel and sewer
is to know the difference between the artist in health and the
artist possessed by an idiosyncrasy as by a devil.</p>
<h3><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>The Worst of It.</h3>
<p>But the present is an age of sentiment: its ideals and
ambitions are mainly emotional; what it chiefly loves is romance
or the affectation of romance, passion, self-conscious solemnity,
and a certain straining after picturesque effects.&nbsp; In
Fielding&rsquo;s time there was doubtless a good deal of
sentimentalism, for his generation delighted not only in Western
and Trunnion and Mrs. Slipslop but in Pamela and Clarissa and the
pathetic Le Fevre.&nbsp; But for all that it was&mdash;at all
events in so far as it was interesting to Fielding and in so far
as Fielding has pictured it&mdash;a generation that knew nothing
of romance but was keenly interested in common sense, and took a
vast deal of honest pleasure in humour and wit and a rather
truculent and full-blooded type of satire.&nbsp; It is plain that
such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between
a past of this sort and such a present as our own must of
necessity be few and small.&nbsp; Their importance, too, is
greatly diminished when you reflect on the nature and tendency of
certain essential elements in Fielding&rsquo;s art and
mind.&nbsp; The most vigorous and the most individual of these is
probably his irony; the next is that abundant vein of purely
intellectual comedy by whose presence his work is exalted to a
place not greatly inferior to that of the <i>Misantrope</i> and
the <i>Ecole des Femmes</i>.&nbsp; These rare and shining
qualities are distinguishing features in the best and <!-- page
234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>soundest part of Fielding.&nbsp; Of irony he is
probably the greatest English master; of pure comedy&mdash;the
intellectual manipulation and transmutation into art of what is
spiritually ridiculous in manners and society&mdash;he is both in
narrative and in dialogue the greatest between Shakespeare and
Mr. George Meredith.&nbsp; And with both our sympathy is
imperfect.&nbsp; We have learned to be sentimental and
self-sufficient with Rousseau, to be romantic and chivalrous with
Scott, to be emotional with Dickens, to take ourselves seriously
with Balzac and George Eliot; there are touches of feeling in our
laughter, even though the feeling be but spite; we have acquired
a habit of politeness&mdash;a tradition of universal
consideration and respect; and our theory of satire is rounded by
the pleasing generalities of Mr. Du Maurier on the one hand and
the malevolent respectability of Mr. W. S. Gilbert on the
other.&nbsp; It is an age of easy writing and still easier
reading: our authors produce for us much in the manner of the
silkworm&mdash;only their term of life is longer; we accept their
results in something of the spirit of them that are interested,
and not commercially, in the processes of silkworms.&nbsp; And M.
Guy de Maupassant can write but hath a devil, and we take him not
because of his writing but because of his devil; and Blank and
Dash and So-and-So and the rest could no more than so many sheep
develop a single symptom of possession among <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>them, and
we take them because a devil and they are incompatibles.&nbsp;
And art is short and time is long; and we care nothing for art
and almost as much for time; and there is little if any to choose
between Mudie&rsquo;s latest &lsquo;catch&rsquo; and last
year&rsquo;s &lsquo;sensation&rsquo; at Burlington House.&nbsp;
And to one of us it is &lsquo;poor Fielding&rsquo;; and to
another Fielding is merely gross, immoral, and dull; and to most
the story of that last journey to Lisbon is unknown, and
Thackeray&rsquo;s dream of Fielding&mdash;a novelist&rsquo;s
presentment of a purely fictitious character&mdash;is the
Fielding who designed and built and finished for eternity.&nbsp;
Which is to be pitied?&nbsp; The artist of <i>Amelia</i> and
<i>Jonathan Wild</i>, the creator of the Westerns and Parson
Adams and Colonel Bath? or we the whippersnappers of
sentiment&mdash;the critics who can neither read nor
understand?</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
